# StemSep-V3 Setup Checklist & Guide Analysis

Based on the deep analysis of `deton24_guide.txt` (approx. 23k lines), here is the status of our models and presets.

## ✅ Verified Models (Present in the downloadable registry)
We have a strong foundation with these key models:
*   **Unwa Series**: `unwa-inst-v1e`, `unwa-inst-fno`, `unwa-big-beta-5e`, `unwa-kim-ft2`
*   **Gabox Series**: `gabox-inst-fv7z`, `gabox-voc-fv4`, `gabox-resurrection`
*   **Becruily Series**: `becruily-inst`, `becruily-vocal`, `mel-band-karaoke-becruily`
*   **Viperx/Roformer**: `bs-roformer-viperx-1297`, `bs-roformer-karaoke-becruily`
*   **Anvuew**: `anvuew-karaoke` (Critical for new Karaoke ensemble)

## ❌ Missing High-Value Models
The guide references these models as SOTA (State of the Art) but they are currently missing from our local assets.
*   **BS-Roformer 2025.07** (MVSEP): Cited as the current best all-rounder. Might be MVSEP exclusive or require manual download if a link exists.
*   **Unwa BS-Roformer-HyperACE**: Cited as having higher instrumental fullness/bleedless than v1e+. Requires custom inference script support (in `bs_roformer.py`) which might be complex to integrate.
*   **Gabox Inst Fv7b**: "Highest bleedless metric", though potentially less full than v1e+.
*   **Mel-Roformer 2024.10**: Cited as a top vocal model.

## 🛠️ Updated Recipes (`recipes.json`)
I have updated `recipes.json` to version **1.2** with the following changes based on the guide:

1.  **Karaoke Ultimate (BS Fusion)** (NEW):
    *   Combines `bs-roformer-karaoke-becruily` + `anvuew-karaoke`.
    *   Guide Recommendation: "BS-Roformer Karaoke Frazer & Becruily + BS-Roformer Karaoke Anvuew (avg/avg)".

2.  **Ultimate Inst (FNO + Becruily)** (NEW):
    *   Combines `unwa-inst-fno` + `becruily-inst` + `unwa-inst-v1e`.
    *   Reasoning: Combines FNO's precision, Becruily's fullness, and V1e's detail.

3.  **Vocal Max Spec (Unwa + Becruily)** (NEW):
    *   Combines `unwa-big-beta-5e` + `becruily-vocal`.
    *   Reasoning: "Unwa bigbeta5 + becruily vocal - Max spec" is cited as a top vocal ensemble.

4.  **Updated Descriptions**: Refined descriptions to match the guide's insights (e.g., highlighting V1e's noise vs. fullness).

## 📝 Recommendations
1.  **Phase Fixer**: The guide heavily emphasizes "Phase Fixer" workflows (using a vocal model to subtract noise from an instrumental model). Our `phase_fix` algorithm supports this. Ensure the frontend allows selecting this algorithm.
2.  **HyperACE Integration**: If we want to support `Unwa BS-Roformer-HyperACE`, we need to check if our `SeparationEngine` supports its specific architecture/inference script variations.
3.  **VRAM Safety**: The guide notes that many new Roformers (like Large/XL variants) need careful `chunk_size` management on <16GB VRAM cards. Our `python-bridge.py` has some VRAM checks, but we should ensure defaults are safe (e.g., `352800` for 8GB cards).
