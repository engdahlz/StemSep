     -  use  Kim  inst  or  inst  3  then   HQ3  has  worse  SDR  vs:    -  voc_ft,  but  given  that  HQ_3  is  an  instrumental  model,  the  latter  can  leave  less  vocal  
residues
 
at
 
times.
  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/leaderboard2.php?id=4029 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/leaderboard2.php?id=3710 These  are  SDR  results  from  the  same  patch,  so  the  voc_ft  vs  HQ_3  comparison  is  valid.   -  MDX23C_D1581  (narrowband)  -  usually  worse  results  than  voc_ft  and  probably  worse  
SDR
 
if
 
evaluation
 
for
 
both
 
models
 
was
 
made
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
patch
  Can  be  a  bit  better  for  instrumentals  “The  new  model  is  very  promising  although  having  noise,  seems  to  pick  vocals  more  accurately  and  the  instrumentals  don't  
have
 
that
 
much
 
of
 
the
 
filtering
 
effect
 
(where
 
entire
 
frequencies
 
are
 
being
 
muted).”
 While  others  say  it’s  worse  than  demucs_ft   -  GSEP  AI an  online  closed  source  service  (cannot  be  installed  on  your  computer  or  your  own  site).  mp3  only,  20kHz  cutoff.  Decent  results  in  some  cases,  click  on  the  link  above  to  read  more  about  GSEP  in  the  specific  section  below.  This  SDR  leaderboard underestimates  it  very  much,  probably  due  to  some  kind  of  post-processing  used  in  GSEP  [probably  noise  gate  and/or  slight  reverb  or  
chunking).
 
As
 
a
 
last
 
resort,
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
4-6
 
stems
 
option
 
and
 
perform
 
mixdown
 
without
 
vocal
 
stem
 
in
 
e.g.
 
Audacity
 
or
 
other
 
DAW.
 
4-6
 
stem
 
option
 
has
 
additional
 
noise
 
cancellation
 
vs
 
2
 
stem.
 
 GSEP  is  good  with  some  tracks  with  not  busy  mix  or  acoustic  songs  where  everything  else  
simply
 
fails,
 
or
 
you’re
 
forced
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
RX10
 
De-bleed
 
feature.
 
  -  GSEP  is  also  better  than  MDX-UVR  instrumental  models  on  at  least  tracks  with  flute  and  
possibly
 
duduk/clarinet
 
or
 
oriental
 
tracks,
 
and
 
possibly
 
tracks
 
with
 
only
 
piano,
 
as
 
it
 
has
 
a
 
decent
 
dedicated
 
piano
 
model.
  -  To  address  the  issue  with  flute  using  MDX-UVR,  use  the  following  ensemble:  Kim_Inst,  
HQ1,
 
HQ2,
 
INST
 
3,
 
Max
 
Spec/Max
 
Spec
 
(Anjok).
  -  Sometimes  kim  inst  and  inst3  models  are  less  vulnerable  to  the  issue  (not  in  all  cases).   -  Also,  main  406  vocal  model  keeps  most  of  these  trumpets/saxes  or  other  similar  
instruments
