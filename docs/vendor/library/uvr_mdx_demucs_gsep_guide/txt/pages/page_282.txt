    In  UVR  and  Not  Eddy’s  Colabs  you  can  change  segment  size  from  512  to  32  in  order  to  
possibly
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
with
 
some
 
older
 
models
 
like
 
e.g.
 
438
 
(it
 
tremendously
 
increases
 
separation
 
time).
  Overlap:  0.93-0.95  (0.7-0.8  seems  to  be  the  best  compromise  for  ensembles,  with  the  
biggest
 
measured
 
SDR
 
for
 
0.99)
  Best  measured  SDR  on  MVSEP  leaderboard  have  currently  following  settings  (but  it  was  
measured
 
on
 
1-minute
 
songs,
 
so
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
potentially
 
different
 
for
 
your
 
song):
  Segment  Size:  4096  Overlap:  0.99   with  512/0.95  worse  by  a  hair  (0.001  SDR)  and  0.9  overlap  for  as  long,  but  still  not  
tremendously
 
long
 
processing
 
time
 
(1h30m31s
 
vs
 
0h46m22s
 
for
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
on
 
GTX
 
1080
 
Ti).
  Also,  segments  12K  performed  worse  than  4K  SDR-wise  (counterintuitively  to  what  it  is  said,  
that
 
higher
 
means
 
better
 
result,
 
but
 
maybe
 
diminishing
 
returns
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
here,
 
so
 
too
 
big
 
values
 
maybe
 
cause
 
SDR
 
drop
 
in
 
some
 
cases)
  It  seemed  to  be  correlated  with  set  overlap.  For  overlap  0.75,  segments  512  was  better  than  1024,   but  for  overlap  0.5,  1024  was  better,  but  the  best  SDR  out  of  these  four  results  has  0.75/512  
setting,
 
although
 
it’s
 
a
 
bit
 
slower
 
than
 
1024,
 
but
 
for
 
0.99
 
overlap,
 
4096
 
segments
 
were
 
better
 
than
 
512.
  SDR  difference  between  overlap  0.95  and  0.99  for  voc_ft  in  UVR  is  0.02.   Segment  size  4096  with  overlap  0.99  (here)  vs  512/0.95  (here)  showed  only  0.001  SDR  difference  for  voc_ft  and  vocals  in  favour  of  the  first  result.   Difference  between  segment  size  512  with  overlap  0.25  (here)  vs  0.95  (here)  is  0,1231  SDR  for  the  latter.   The  difference  between  default  segment  size  256  with  overlap  0.25  (here)  vs  512/0.95  (here)  is  0,1948  SDR  for  vocals,  and  0,1969  with  denoiser  on  (standard,  not  model),  and  0.95  is  
longer
 
by
 
triple.
 1024/0.25  vs  256  has  not  much  longer  processing  time  (7  vs  6  mins)  than  default  settings,  
and
 
better
 
SDR
 
by
 
0.0865
  For  overlap  0.75,  segments  512  were  better  than  1024  (at  least  on  1  minute  audio).   Measurement  is  logarithmic,  meaning  that  1  SDR  is  10x  difference.
