[page 65/642]
    Small  Patch (You  must  have  a  Roformer  patch  previously  installed  for  this  to  work)  Changelog:  Apollo  fixes:  “Chunk  sizes  can  now  be  set  to  lower  values  (between  1-6)  Overlap  can  be  turned  off  (set  to  0)”  Fix  both  for  Apollo  and  Roformers:  now  5  seconds  or  shorter  input  files  no  longer  cause  
errors.
 OpenCL  was  wrongly  referenced  in  the  UVR.  It  was  actually  DirectML  all  the  way,  and  Anjok  
changed
 
all
 
the
 
OpenCL
 
names
 
in
 
the
 
app
 
into
 
DirectML.
  -  Unwa  released  a  new  Kim-Mel-Band-Roformer-FT  vocal  model |  Colab It  enhances  both  our  new  bleedless  (36.95  vs  36.75)  and  fullness  (16.40  vs  16.26)  metric for  vocals  vs  the  original  Mel  Kim  model.  SDR-wise  it’s  also  a  tad  lower  (10.97  vs  11.02)  (thx  Bas  Curtiz)

 https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/issues/1#issuecomment-2525052333 If  they  sing  at  intervals  (one  by  one),  they  cannot  be  separated.  
Works
 
pretty
 
good,
 
bleed
 
might
 
occur
 
occasionally.
 
Also,
 
it
 
seems
 
to
 
pick
 
up
 
various
 
people
 
dialogues.
 
 If  you  want  to  use  the  model  in  UVR,  use  this config  (thx  Essid)  If  you  have  "The  size  of  tensor  a  (352768)  must  match  the  size  of  tensor  b  (352800)  at  non-singleton  dimension  1"  e.g.  in  python-audio-separator,  use  this config  (thx  Eddycrack864)  -  Anjok  released  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #8  for  Win:  full |  patch |  Mac:  M1 |  x86-64 -  UVR_Patch_12_3_24_1_18_BETA  
Apollo
 
arch
 
was
 
made
 
compatible
 
with
 
MacOS
 
MPS
 
(metal)
 
and
 
OpenCL,
 
but
 
with
 
it,
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
unstable
 
and
 
very
 
RAM
 
intensive
 
-
 
use
 
chunk
 
size
 
over
 
7
 
to
 
prevent
 
errors
 
(currently
 
it’s
 
not
 
certain
 
that
 
all
 
models
 
will
 
work
 
with
 
less
 
than
 
12GB
 
of
 
VRAM).
 
Apollo
 
is
 
now
 
compatible
 
with
 
all
 
Lew
 
models
 
(fixed
 
incompatibility
 
with
 
any
 
other
 
than
 
previously
 
available
 
in
 
Download
 
Center).
 
Fixed
 
(presumably
 
regression
 
with)
 
Matchering.
 
 
How
 
would
 
I
 
assign
 
a
 
yaml
 
config
 
to
 
an
 
Apollo
 
model
 
on
 
the
 
new
 
UVR
 
[patch]?
 
“1.
 
Open
 
the
 
Apollo
 
models
 
folder
 2.  Drop  the  model  into  the  folder  3.  From  the  Apollo  models  folder,  drop  the  yaml  into  the  model_configs  directory  4.  From  the  GUI,  choose  the  model  you  just  added  and  if  the  model  is  not  recognized,  a  
pop-up
 
window
 
will
 
appear,
 
and
 
you'll
 
have
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
choose
 
the
 
yaml
 
to
 
associate
 
with
 
the
 
model.”

some

The
