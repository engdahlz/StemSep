    Anjok  stated  that  the  hardest  genre  for  separation  is  metal  and  vocal-centered  mixes.  If  the  
instrumental
 
has
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
noise,
 
e.g.
 
distorted
 
guitars,
 
the
 
instrumental
 
will
 
come
 
out
 
muddier.
 Tracks  from  the  70s  and  80s  can  separate  well.  The  50-60s  will  be  harder,  e.g.  recorded  in  
mono.
 
The
 
early
 
stereo
 
era
 
gets
 
a
 
little
 
better.

 -  Jamaroquoi  -  Virtual  Insanity  ("One  of  the  most  difficult  challenges  of  all  my

 Others:  -  Beyonce  -  I'm  that  girl  -  Half  Alive  -  Still  feel  -  Queen  -  White  Queen  -  Queen  -  Bohemian  Rhapsody  (very  complicated  song;  mix  of  various  vocals  and  
guitars)

 -  J  Dilla  -  Don't  Cry  (lots  of  so-called  lo-fi  “cuts”  or  chops  of  vocals  from  old  vinyls,  
characteristic
 
for
 
hip-hop
 
productions

are
 
sometimes
 
harder

 -  Lots  of  Juice  WRLD  (his  tracks  have  leftovers  here  and  there,  e.g.  in  "Off  the  rip
