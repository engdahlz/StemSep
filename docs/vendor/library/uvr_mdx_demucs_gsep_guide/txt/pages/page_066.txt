    preconfigured  to  use  15GB  of  VRAM.  “chunk_size  has  influence  on  results,  colab  uses

 -  Anjok  released  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #7  for  Windows:  full |  patch -  UVR_Patch_12_2_24_2_20_BETA  (version  for  Mac  probably  tonight,  observe or  on  GH)  It  introduces  support  for  Apollo  arch.  The  OG  mp3  enhancer  and  Lew  v1  vocal  enhancer  
were
 
added
 
to
 
Download
 
Center.
 
Probably,
 
now
 
you’ll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
add
 
newer
 
Lew
 
uni
 
enhancer
 
and
 
v2
 
vocal
 
enhancer
 
manually.
 
The
 
arch
 
is
 
located
 
in
 
Audio
 
Tools.
 
Sadly,
 
this
 
arch
 
cannot
 
be
 
GPU-accelerated
 
with
 
OpenCL,
 
so
 
using
 
AMD
 
and
 
Intel
 
cards
 
(you’re
 
forced
 
to
 
use
 
CPU,
 
which
 
might
 
be
 
long).
 
Also,
 
“Phase
 
Swapper”
 
a.k.a.
 
Phase
 
fixer
 
for
 
Unwa
 
inst
 
models
 
was
 
added
 
to
 
Audio
 
Tools.
 
 
-
 
New
 
SCNet
 
and
 
MelBand
 
DnR
 
v3
 
(SFX)
 
models
 
were
 
added
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
(along
 
with
 
optional
 
ensemble).
 
“The
 
metrics
 
turned
 
out
 
to
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
those
 
of
 
the
 
similar
 
model
 
Bandit
 
v2”

-
 
We
 
fixed
 
some
 
issues
 
(IndexError)
 
with
 
jarredou’s
 
inference
 
Colab
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
recent
 
updates
 
in
 
the
 
ZFTurbo
 
code
 
(thx
 
for
 
the
 
heads-up,
 
MrG).
  -  Anjok  released  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #6  for  MacOS  as  well:  M1 | x86-64  -  Lew  released  a  new  Apollo  universal  model for  upscaling  various  lossy  audio  files  (added  on  MVSEP  and  x-minus  premium).  
Unlike
 
the
 
previous
 
mp3
 
model,
 
it’s
 
able
 
to
 
enhance
 
any
 
formats
 
and
 
not
 
only
 
mp3,
 
including
 files  with  hard  cutoff  like  in  AAC  128  kbps  (see),  it  struggles  with  48  kbps  files.  “If  anyone  wants  to  run  the  new  model  in  Colab [already  added],  set  chunk_size  to  19.  Then  the  model  uses  14.7GB  VRAM”  (Essid).  Sometimes  a  lower  setting  is  necessary  (e.g.  for  a  3  
minute
 
song,
 
otherwise
 
memory
 
error
 
will
 
appear).
 As  for  27.11.24  it  doesn’t  work  with  MSST  yet,  later  added  support  in  UVR  patch.   
“Actually
 
much
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
original
 
Apollo
 
model.
 
It
 
handles
 
artifacts
 
really
 
well
 and  also  noise,  it  understands  noise  while  [the]  OG  model  doesn't  for  some  reason”  John  
UVR/simplcup
  Specifically  for  any  muddy  Roformer  vocals,  still  use  Lew  vocal  enhancer  v1/2  as  they're  better  for  this  task,  though  they  can  be  noisy  (available  in  the  Colab).    “I  also  included  checkpoint you  can  continue  training  from”  (mirror)  “Q:  segments:  5.4  -  can  I  assume  that  chunck_size  if  5.4  *  44100?  
A:
 
Yes,
 
and
 
dims
 
384
 The  smaller  one  for  inference  and  bigger  one  for  training  
Q:
 
Does
 
that
 
model
 
has
 
a
 
dataset
 
of
 
a
 
wide
 
variety
 
of
 
compression
 
noise
 
and
 
artifacts?
 A:  mp2,  mp3,  ogg,  wma,  aac,  opus,  low  band  width  wavs.  Random  speed  change  
augmentations
 
were
 
used
 
too.”
 
“It
 
was
 
mostly
 
trained
 
on
 
music”
