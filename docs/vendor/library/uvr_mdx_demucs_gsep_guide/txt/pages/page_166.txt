    UVR>Tools>Matchering).  It  will  have  less  bleeding  than  models  with  low  bleedless  metric,  but  still  fuller  than  phase-fixed  results  (more  here and  here).  Phase  fixer  can  also  be  used  in  a  standalone  Python  script or  in  the  latest  UVR.  Matchering  can  be  used  in  Colab or  songmastr or  locally (it’s  very  lightweight  and  doesn’t  require  a  GPU).    Recent  bleedless  models   -  Unwa  BS-Roformer-Inst-FNO |  separate  Colab #3  Inst.  fullness:  32.03,  bleedless:  42.87,  SDR:  17.60  Incompatible  with  UVR,  install  MSST,  then  read  model  instructions  here (requires  modifying  bs_roformer.py  file  in  MSST,  also  models_utils.py  for  PyTorch  newer  than  2.6).  Actually  similar  results  to  BS-Resurrection  inst  model  above,  less  fullness.  Some  people  even  prefer  Gabox  BS_ResurrectioN  instead.  “Very  small  amount  of  noise  compared  to  other  fullness  inst  models,  while  keeping  enough  
fullness
 
IMO.
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
if

is
 
needed.
 
Maybe
 
it's

needed
 
a
 
little
 
bit.”

results.

I'd

it's
 
roughly
 
comparable

 “I  replaced  the  MLP  of  the  BS-Roformer  mask  estimator  with  FNO1d  [Fourier  Neural

it,

 “on  the  fuller  side,  somewhere  around  inst  v1e+,  maybe  a  tiny  bit  below.  The  main  thing  I
