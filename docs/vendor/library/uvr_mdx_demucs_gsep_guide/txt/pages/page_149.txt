     -  New  BVE  model  will  be  ready  at  the  beginning  of  August  (Aufr33).   -  MDX23C  by  ZFTurbo  model(s)  added  on  mvsep.com.  They're  trained  by  him  using  the  new  
2023
 
MDX-Net
 
V3
 
arch.
 Slightly  worse  SDR  than  MDX23  2.1  Colab  on  its  own.  Might  be  good  for  rock,  the  best  when  all  three  models  are  weighted/ensembled)   -  MDX23C  ensemble/weighted  available  on  mvsep.com  for  premium  users  (best  SDR  for  
public
 
2
 
stem
 
model).
 It  might  still  leave  some  instrumental  residues  in  vocals  of  some  tracks  (which  can  be  
cleared
 
with
 
MDX-UVR
 
HQ_3
 
model)
 
but
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
also
 
vice
 
versa
 
-
  
the
 
same
 
issue
 
as
 
kim
 
vocal
 
models,
 
where
 
the
 
vocals
 
are
 
slightly
 
left
 
in
 
the
 
instrumentals
 
[vs
 
e.g.
 
MDX23
 
2.1
 
free
 
of
 
the
 
issue]
 On  some  Modern  Talking  and  CC  tracks  it  can  give  the  best  results  so  far).   -  If  you  have  problems  with  “Error  when  uploading  file”  on  MVSEP,  use  VPN.  Similar  issues  
can
 
happen
 
for
 
free
 
X-Minus
 
for
 
users
 
in
 
Turkey.
  -  lalal.ai  cooperation  with  MVSEP  was  fake  news.  Go  along.   -  As  for  Drumsep,  besides  in  fixed  Colab,  you  can  also  use  it  (the  separation  of  single  percussion  instruments  from  drums  stem)  in  UVR  GUI.  How  to  do  this:  Go  to  UVR  settings  and  open  the  application  directory.  Find  the  folder  "models"  and  go  to  "demucs  models"  then  "v3_v4"  Copy  and  paste  both  the  .th and  .yaml files,  and  it's  good  to  go.  Overlap  above  0.6  or  0.7  becomes  placebo,  at  least  for  dry  track,  with  no  effects.   -  Drumsep  benefits  from  shifts  a  lot  (you  can  use  even  20).   -  For  better  results,  test  out  potentially  also  -6  semitones  in  UVR  beta,  or  with  31183Hz  
sample
 
rate
 
with
 
changed
 
tempo.
 12  semitones  from  44100Hz  is  22050  and  should  be  rather  less  usable  in  most  cases,  the  
same
 
for
 
tempo
 
preservation
 
on.
  -  If  you  have  a  long  band_net  error log  while  using  DeNoise  model  by  Fox  Joy  in  UVR,  reinstall  the  app.   -  It  can  happen  that  every  second  separation  using  MDX  Colab  will  fail  due  to  memory  
issues,
 
at
 
least
 
with
 
Karaoke
 
2
 
model.
 
  -  New  fine-tuned  vocal  model  added  to  UVR5  GUI  download  center  and  HV  Colab  (slightly  
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
Kim
 
Vocal
 
2)
 
it's
 
called
 
"UVR-MDX-Net-Voc_FT"
 
and
 
is
 
narrowband
 
(because
 
it's
 
based
 
on
 
previous
 
models).
