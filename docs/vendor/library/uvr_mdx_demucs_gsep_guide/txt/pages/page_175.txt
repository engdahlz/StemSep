your

fragments

from
 
the

moments

as
 
it
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
even
 
less
 
vocal
 
bleeding,
 
but
 
more
 
muddiness
 
if
 
necessary)
  0)  Propositions  of  models  for  phase  fixer  to  alleviate  vocal  residues  (from  the  above)   a)  Becruily  voc  with  Becruily  inst  (muddy  but  very  few  residues  if  any)  b)  FT3  with  V1e+   c)  Unwa  Beta  6  with  inst_gabox3  (although  it  might  be  less  consistent  than  the  top)  d)  Unwa  Revive  model  is  also  good  with  any  instrumental  model  e)  Unwa  Bigbeta5  used  to  be  not  bad  either.  f)  Or  any  of  the  vocal  models  above  with  e.g.  V1e  (it's  pretty  full,  and  it  might  be  not  enough  
for
 
it
 
nevertheless)
  How  to  use  the  phase  fixer  in  UVR?  Separate  with  vocal  model,  then  with  instrumental  model.  Go  to  Audio  Tools>Phase  
swapper,
 
and
 
use
 
vocal
 
model
 
result
 
as
 
reference,
 
and
 
instrumental
 
as
 
target
  __   Ensembles  (for  instrumentals;  check  out  also  DAW  ensemble with  the  below)  If  you  find  some  phase  fixer  results  (e.g.  ensembled)  unsatisfactory,  use  the  Phase  Fixer  Colab -  it's  tweaked  for  better  results  than  UVR  and  standalone  scripts .   0)  BS-Roformer  HyperACE  Inst  v2  +  2025.07  (Max  FFT)  using  100/100  as  values  for  phase

 —->My  [former]  favorite  ensemble  right  now.  Though,  I  notice  it  produce  vocal  bleed  
sometimes
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
noisy
 
at
 
some
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
songs
 
while
 
the
 
noise
 
might
 
be
 
totally
 
absent
 
in
 
other
 
parts

the
