    -  BS-Roformer  model  trained  by  viperx  was  added  on  x-minus  (it's  different  from  the  v2  
model
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
and
 
has
 
higher
 
SDR,
 
it's
 
the
 
“1.0”
 
one).
 
If
 
it's
 
better
 
vs
 
V2
 
might
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song.
 It  struggles  with  saxophone  and  e.g.  some  Arabic  guitars.   -  (x-minus  -  aufr33)  “I  have  just  completed  training  a  new  UVR  De-noise  model.  Unlike  the  
previous
 
version,
 
it
 
is
 
less
 
aggressive
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
remove
 
SFX.
 It  was  trained  on  a  modified  dataset.  I  reduced  the  noise  level  and  made  it  more  uniform,  
removed
 
footsteps,
 
crowd,
 
cars
 
and
 
so
 
on
 
from
 
the
 
noise
 
stems.
 
On
 
the
 
contrary,
 
the
 
crowd
 
is
 
now
 
a
 
useful
 
/
 
dry
 
signal.
 
(...)
 
The
 
new
 
model
 
is
 
designed
 
mainly
 
to
 
remove
 
hiss,
 
such
 
as
 
preamp
 
noise.”
 For  vocals  that  have  pops  or  clipping  crackles  or  other  audio  irregularities,  use  the  old  
denoise
 
model.
  -  Dango.ai  updated  their  model,  also  giving  some  kind  of  demudder  to  the  instrumentals,  
enhancing
 
their
 
results.
 
Results
 
might
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
MDX23C
 
and
 
BS-Roformer
 
v2.
 
Still,
 
it’s
 
pretty
 
pricey
 
(8$
 
for
 
10
 
separations).
 
5x
 
30
 
seconds
 
fragments
 
per
 
IP
 
can
 
be
 
obtained
 
for
 
free,
 
and
 
usually
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
reset.
 
“It’s
 
$8
 
for
 
10
 
tracks
 
x
 
6
 
minutes,
 
all
 
aggressiveness
 
modes
 
included
 
(but
 
vocal
 
and
 
inst
 
models
 
are
 
separate).
 
The
 
entire
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
for
 
proper
 
SDR
 
check
 
would
 
cost
 
around
 
$133.”

  -  Be  aware  that  queues  on  https://doubledouble.top/ are  much  shorter  for  Deezer  than  Qobuz  links.  If  there’s  no  24  bit  versions  for  your  music,  use  Deezer  instead.   
[outdated;
 
currently
 
there’s
 
no
 
longer
 
any
 
MQA
 
files
 
on
 
Tidal]
 
Also,
 
avoid
 
Tidal
 
and
 
16
 
bit
 
FLACs
 
from
 
“Max”
 
quality,
 
which
 
is
 
slightly
 
lossy
 
MQA.
 
Use
 
24
 
bit
 
MQA
 
from
 
Tidal
 
only
 
when
 
there’s
 
no
 
24
 
bit
 
on
 
Qobuz.
 
Most
 
older
 
albums
 
under
 
2020
 
are
 
16
 
bit
 
MQA
 
instead
 
of
 
24
 
bit
 
MQA
 
on
 
Tidal,
 
and
 
are
 
lossy
 
compared
 
to
 
Deezer
 
and
 
Qobuz
 
which
 
doesn’t
 
use
 
MQA
 
(so
 
doubledouble
 
doesn’t
 
convert
 
MQA
 
to
 
FLAC
 
like
 
on
 
Tidal).
 
MQA
 
is
 
only
 
“slightly”
 
lossy,
 
because
 
it
 
affects
 
frequencies
 
mainly
 
from
 
18kHz
 
and
 
up,
 
and
 
not
 
greatly.
