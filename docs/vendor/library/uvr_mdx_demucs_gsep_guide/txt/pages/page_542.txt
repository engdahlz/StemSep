    found,  they  don’t  delete  accounts  which  have  YouTube  account  with  at  least  one  video  
uploaded
 
(not
 
sure
 
if
 
it
 
must
 
be
 
online
 
and
 
public).
 
I
 
had
 
a
 
case
 
few
 
times
 
with
 
revoked
 
privileges
 
to
 
some
 
documents
 
on
 
GDoc,
 
which
 
were
 
changed
 
to
 
private
 
without
 
my
 
knowledge.
 
Can’t
 
guarantee
 
if
 
the
 
same
 
cannot
 
happen
 
with
 
GDrive
 
files.

I’ve
 
seen
 
very
 
old
 
uploads
 
from
 
there.

 4shared.com Max  3GB  of  daily  traffic,  30GB  per  month  (Once  I  got  my  account  deleted  over  years,  maybe  due  to  inactivity,  but  even  if  I  was  
warned,
 
messages
 
were
 
coming
 
into
 
Gmail
 
spam)

 fileditch.com It  allows  sharing  direct  links  like  from  FTP  or  GitHub  when  you  upload  file  on  release  page  
where
 
also
 
bigger
 
files
 
can
 
be
 
uploaded
 
vs
 
50MB
 
in
 
source
 
files.
 
I
 
see
 
9
 
months
 
old
 
links
 
still
 
active
 
from
 
fileditch.
 
Download
 
can
 
however
 
be
 
slow,
 
5
 
mbits,
 
on
 
old
 
files
 
that
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
accessed
 
in
 
30
 
days.

 safe.fiery.me I  think  this  has  no  expiration,  not  sure   10GB  https://box.com 250MB  file  limit  for  free   
11GB
 yandex.com/client/disk At  least  after  the  war,  some  users  started  to  report  very  slow  downloads.   
Rare
 
DCMAs
 
vs
 
Mega.
 
 
Since
 
2022
 
difficult
 
registration
 
without
 
a
 
phone,
 
and/or
 
when
 
you
 
use
 
public
 
SMS
 
receiving
 
gate
 
and/or
 
VPN
 
e.g.
 
Russian
 
-
 
they
 
can
 
prevent
 
you
 
from
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
disk
 
right
 
after
 
registration
 
if
 
they
 
detect
 
something
 
suspicious
 
during
 
registration
 
process,
 
after
 
the
 
war
 
they
 
decreased
 
max
 
file
 
size
 
limit
 
to
 
1GB
 
iirc.
 
 
Also,
 
there
 
are
 
very
 
little
 
means
 
to
 
recover
 
your
 
account
 
in
 
case
 
your
 
secret
 
name
 
miraculously
 
get
 
changed,
 
and
 
using
 
new
 
ISP
 
or
 
after
 
long
 
inactivity,
 
you’re
 
asked
 
for
 
it
 
(I
 
had
 
such
 
situation
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
and
 
IDK
 
how
 
long
 
the
 
files
 
are
 
stored
 
on
 
inactive
 
accounts).
 
Attempts
 
of
 
using
 
automated
 
forms
 
to
 
fill
 
for
 
account
 
recovery
 
are
 
vain
 
(esp.
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
know
 
precise
 
account
 
creation
 
dates,
 
didn’t
 
use
 
their
 
email,
 
etc.).
 
Even
 
if
 
you’re
 
logged
 
into
 
their
 
Disk
 
app
 
on
 
the
 
phone,
 
you
 
cannot
 
change
 
any
 
account
 
related
 
information
 
like
 
secret
