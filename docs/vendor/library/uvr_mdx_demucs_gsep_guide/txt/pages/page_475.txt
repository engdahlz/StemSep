     How  to…  abuse  it.  Doesn't  always  work  for  everyone,  and  sometimes  you'll  receive  only  19

snippets.
  Go  to  the  signin/register  screen  and  use  a  temp  email  from  https://tempail.com/ When  you  are  in,  make  sure  you  use  the  settings  with  a  P  icon,  P  meaning  Pheonix,  which  
seems
 
to
 
be
 
some
 
hybrid

made
 I'd  recommend  making  the  processesing  level  normal,  although  you  can  play  around  with  the  
settings
 
to
 
see
 
what
 
sounds
 
better
 They  will  later  process  it  and  since  lalal  has  shorter  queues,  you  get  them  faster.  It  took  me  
like
 
10
 
seconds
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
preview
 
for
 
a
 
song
 
and
 
20
 
seconds
 
for
 
full
 
which
 
is
 
wild.
 You  will  get  a  sample  and  if  you  like  it,  you  can  submit  it  and  get  your  stems!"  You  can  also  use  dots  in  Gmail  addresses,  instead  of  +1  (and  more)  at  the  end,  which  is  
unsupported
 
in
 
lalal.
 
You'll
 
receive
 
your
 
email
 
with
 
dots
 
in
 
its
 
username
 
anyway,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
treated
 
as
 
a
 
separate
 
email
 
by
 
their
 
system.
  Their  app  uploads  input  files  to  separate  on  external  servers.
