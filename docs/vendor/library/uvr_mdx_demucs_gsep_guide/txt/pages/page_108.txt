     -  Since  patch  #3,  Roformers’  separation  times  with  even  smaller  overlap  are  longer  than  
before.
 
Also,
 
remember
 
about
 
inference
 
mode
 
added
 
in
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
later
 
patches.
 
It’s
 
disabled
 
by
 
default
 
as
 
it
 
causes
 
silent
 
separation
 
issues
 
on
 
GTX
 
10XX
 
GPUs
 
and
 
probably
 
older.
 
Enabling
 
it
 
on
 
newer
 
GPUs
 
might
 
be
 
beneficial
 
for
 
performance
  -  If  UVR  freezes  your  PC  occasionally  during  separation,  you  can  change  priority  of  UVR  to  
Idle
 
in
 
Task
 
manager,
 
and
 
the
 
issue
 
is
 
gone
 
sooner
 
or
 
later.
  You  can  force  it  to  remember  every  time  you  run  UVR  with  Process  Lasso  (it  autostarts  with  
the
 
OS,
 
so
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
splash
 
screen
 
for
 
a
 
free
 
user
 
every
 
time
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
it).

Ensembling  impossible  -  model  not  visible  in  vocal  splitter  in  UVR  
-  If  user-imported  Roformers  aren't  recognized  in  "instrumental/vocals"  in  ensemble  or  in  
vocal
 
splitter,
 
but
 
are
 
in
 
"multi-stem
 
ensemble":
 
“The
 
.yaml
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
model
 
usually
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
updated
 
to
 
match
 
UVR's
 
stem
 
naming
 
conventions.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
your
 
config
 
shows
 
the
 
instruments
 
as
 
"other"
 
and
 
"vocals",
 
it
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
updated
 
to
 
"Instrumental"
 
and
 
"Vocals"
 
(case-sensitive)”

 E.g.  for  Karaoke  models,  you  need  to  change  “Karaoke”  to  “Vocals”.  
 
But
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
Tools>Manual
 
Ensemble
 
instead
 
for
 
ready
 
separations.
  Ensemble  vs  multi-stem  ensemble  explained  (by  stephanie)   “The  multi-stem  ensemble  mode  is  designed  to  ensemble  every  stem  in  all  the  models  that  
were
 
selected.
 
I'll
 
explain
 
how
 
it's
 
related:
 Let’s  say  you  have  two  vocal/instrumental  models  selected,  and  two  4-stem  models  selected  
(vocals,
 
drums,
 
bass,
 
other),
 
then
 
it
 
will
 
process
 
the
 
song
 
through
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
models.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
the
 
final
 
ensembled
 
output
 
will
 
be
 
5
 
stems:
 
vocals,
 
instrumental,
 
drums,
 
bass,
 
and
 
other.
 
  The  drums,  bass,  and  other  stems  will  just  be  the  ensemble  of  the  2  models  in  that  selection  
that
 
shared
 
those
 
outputs.
 
However,
 
all
 
models
 
in
 
that
 
particular
 
selection
 
shared
 
a
 
vocal
 
output
 
so
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
ensemble
 
of
 
each
 
model's
 
vocal
 
output
 
 I'm  not  sure  if  that's  very  clear,  but  that's  how  it  works  and  why  the  way  it  handles  each  stem  
is
 
different
 
from
 
the
 
other
 
stem
 
pair
 
modes”
