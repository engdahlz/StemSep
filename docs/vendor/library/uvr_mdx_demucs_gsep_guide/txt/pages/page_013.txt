 For  some  reason  it  seems  to  give  worse  results  than  the  ckpt  anvuew  shared.   -  Dear  friends  at  Apple  Music.  Please  stop  harassing  labels  and  their  sound  engineers  for  
making
 
Atmos
 
mixes
 
using
 
our
 
and
 
yours
 
awesome
 
AI
 
models
 
for
 
audio
 
separation.
 
The
 
artificial
 
artifacts
 
you're
 
solely
 
looking
 
for
 
in
 
spectrograms
 
in
 
separate
 
channels
 
are
 
inaudible
 
in
 
the
 
entire
 
tracks.
 
The
 
tracks
 
are
 
well
 
mixed
 
and
 
accepted
 
by
 
major
 
labels,
 
but
 
rejected
 
by
 
your
 
lazy
 
ass
 
incompetent
 
bullshit.
 
The
 
quality
 
of
 
Atmos
 
mixes
 
got
 
better
 
since
 
the
 
very
 
beginning,
 
and
 
either
 
your
 
employees,
 
or
 
your
 
algorithms,
 
or
 
both,
 
do
 
a
 
lazy
 
job
 
without
 
even
 
hearing
 
the
 
shit
 
on
 
their
 
own,
 
while
 
still
 
rejecting
 
stuff
 
without
 
sensible
 
reason!
 
You're
 
making
 
things
 
nasty
 
difficult
 
for
 
artists
 
who
 
lost
 
their
 
multitracks
 
for
 
certain
 
legacy
 
songs,
 
rendering
 
re-releasing
 
of
 
their
 
albums
 
in
 
Atmos
 
potentially
 
impossible.
 
Bring
 
it
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
executives.
 
Get
 
your
 
shit
 
together,
 
for
 
fuck
 
sakes!
  -  Full  release  of  mesk’s  rifforge  Mel-Roformer  model focused  on  inst/voc  separation  for  metal  music  “The  model  can  have  some  quirks  (just  like  most  models)  but  it's  all  around  clean  for  me  to  
release.”
 Training  details:  
“Characteristics:
 This  is  a  dimension  512  depth  24  model  (so  fairly  large  file  size  at  1.9  GB!),  with  an  SDR  of  
14.2436.
 It's  finetuned  from  an  older  Melband  Roformer  checkpoint  with  an  SDR  of  13.7.”   -  Gabox  released  experimental  BS-Roformer  karaoke  model |  metrics It  gives  the  same  error  for  RTX  5000  UVR  patch  users  as  the  avuew’s  model.   -  New  ensemble  (avg)  of  anvuew’s  and  becruily  &  frazer  karaoke  models  was  evaluated  on  the  leaderboard  (metrics lower  than  BSkarfrazerBecruily+BSkarMVSEP+MBkarGaboxV2  SDR-wise).  Probably  you  could  make  a  fusion  model out  of  the  two  to  save  on  inference  time  in  cost  of  slight  SDR  decrease  (both  use  the  same  config  so  it  might  work).   -  erosunica  found  out  that  BS-Roformer  SW  drums  is  “really  good  to  remove  some  SFX  and  
foley,
 
way
 
better
 
than
 
DnR
 
v3”
  -  Gabox  released  voc_fv7  beta  1  Mel-Roformer  model |  yaml |  Colab Voc.  fullness:  21.21,  bleedless:  30.81,  SDR:  10.96  "Just  a  better  fv4  it  seems,  better  bleedless"  (fullness:  21.33,  bleedless:  29.07,  SDR  10.58)  vs  voc_fv4  "It  is  noisier..  Kinda  closer  to  beta  5e?”  “It's  slightly  less  noise  and  fullness  than  
beta
 
5e
 
but
 
picking
 
up
 
the
 
backing
 
vocals
 
REALLY
 
well,
 
significantly
 
better
 
than
 
beta
 
5e”
 But  it's  pulling  the  backing  vocals  out  even  better  than  5e”  “the  backing  vocals  are  so  good!
