___  
Last  updates  and  news   -  jarredou  evaluated  different  chunk_size  settings  and  how  they  affect  different  evaluation  
parameters
 
on
 
the
 
deux
 
model.
 
Vocal
 
stem
 
was
 
tested,
 
but
 
he
 
said
 
the
 
inst
 
stem
 
has
 
similar
 
curves.
 Best  SDR:  705600  (possibly  the  least  crossbleeding)  Best  fullness:  1102500  (requires  lots  of  VRAM)  Best  bleedless:  441000  (still  not  low  enough  for  4GB  VRAM  on  AMD  and  Intel  GPUs  in  
UVR)
 Default  in  the  yaml:  573300  (becruily’s  recommendation  till  at  least  now)  “I  also  did  the  same  test  as  jarredou,  before  releasing  and  inded  705600  gave  the  highest  
SDR
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
added
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
noise
 
(for
 
instrumentals
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
good,
 
for
 
vocals
 
not
 
so
 
much)
 so  I  found  573300  to  be  a  good  middle  ground  between  fullness/bleedness/SDR”  -  becruily  “882000  -  seems  the  maximum  viable  one  if  you  aim  for  best  fullness  before  such  
diminishing
 
returns”

 More  -  (uvronline)  “I  updated  the  pre/post  processing  for  the  Male/Female  and  Mel-RoFormer  
Lead/Back
 
models.
 
Now
 
the
 
Deux
 
model
 
is
 
used,
 
so
 
the
 
instrumentals
 
will
 
be
 
less
 
muddy.”

  -  (uvronline)  The  new  Deux  model  by  becruily  added.  It  uses  vocals  stem  and  instrumental  is  
inversion,
 
not
 
dedicated
 
instrumental
 
stem,
 
and
 
that's
 
how
 
becruily
 
recommends
 
to
 
use
 
it.
 
It
 
was
 
fixed,
 
and
 
was
 
actually
 
a
 
mistake.
 “Another  improvement:  since  the  deux  model  creates  two  stems,  phase  correction  is  now  
applied
 
immediately.
 
You
 
don't
 
need
 
the
 
correct
 
phase
 
button
 
“-
 
Aufr33.
 
At
 
least
 
before,
 
phase
 
fixer
 
was
 
only
 
for
 
premium.
