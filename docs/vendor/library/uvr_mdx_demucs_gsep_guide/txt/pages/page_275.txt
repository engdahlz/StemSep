    -  Passing  through  a  Karaoke  model  may  help  a  bit  with  this  issue  (Mateus  Contini  method).    -  inst  HQ_1  (450)/HQ_2  (498)/HQ_3  MDX-UVR  fullband  models  in  Download  center  of

-
 
great
 
high
 
quality
 
models
 
to
 
use
 
in
 
most
 
cases.
 
The
 
latter
 
a
 
bit
 
better
 
SDR,
 
possibly
 
a
 
bit
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
Not
 
so
 
few
 
like
 
inst3
 
or
 
kim
 
ft
 
other
 
in
 
specific
 
cases,
 
but
 
a
 
good
 
point
 
to
 
start.
  What  you  need  to  know  about  MDX-UVR  models  is  that  they're  divided  into  instrumental  and  
vocal
 
models
 
and
 
that
 
instrumental
 
models
 
will
 
always
 
leave
 
some
 
instrumental
 
residues
 
in
 
vocals
 
and
 
vice
 
versa
 
-
 
vocal
 
models
 
will
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
leave
 
some
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
instrumentals.
 
But
 
you
 
can
 
still
 
encounter
 
specific
 
cases
 
of
 
songs
 
when
 
breaking
 
that
 
rule
 
will
 
benefit
 
you
 
-
 
that
 
might
 
depend
 
on
 
the
 
specific
 
song.
 
Usually,
 
instrumental
 
model
 
should
 
give
 
better
 
instrumental
 
if
 
you’re
 
fighting
 
with
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
  Also,  MDX-UVR  models  can  sometimes  pick  up  sound  midi  effects  which  won’t  be  
recovered.
  -  kim  inst  (a.k.a.  ft  other)  -  cutoff,  cleaner  results  and  better  SDR  than  inst3/464  but  tends  to  
be
 
more
 
noisy
 
than
 
inst3
 
at
 
times.
 
Use:
  -  inst3/464  -  to  get  more  muddy,  but  less  noisy  results,  although  it  all  depends  on  a  song,  
and
 
sometimes
 
HQ_1/2/3
 
models
 
provides
 
generally
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
(or
 
more
 
detestable).
  -  MDX23  by  ZFTurbo  v1  -  the  third  place  in  the  newest  MDX  challenge.  4  stem.  Already  
much
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
Demucs
 
ft
 
(4)
 
model.
 
More
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
e.g.
 
HQ_2
 
or
 
Kim
 
inst,
 
but
 
very
 
clean
 
results,
 
if
 
not
 
the
 
cleanest
 
among
 
all
 
at
 
the
 
time.
 
Jarredou
 
in
 
his
 
fork
 
fixed
 
lots
 
of
 
those
 
issues
 
and
 
further
 
enhanced
 
the
 
SDR
 
so
 
it’s
 
comparable
 
with
 
Ensemble
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
which
 
was
 
also
 
further
 
enhanced
 
since
 
the
 
first
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
code
 
released
 
in
 
2023,
 
and
 
also
 
has
 
newer
 
models
 
and
 
various
 
enhancements.
  -  Demucs  4 (especially  ft  4  stem  model;  UVR5,  Colab,  MVSEP,  6s  available)  -  Demucs  models  don't  have  so  aggressive  noise  cancellation  and  missing  instruments  issue  like  in  
GSEP.
 
Check
 
it
 
out
 
too
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
(but
 
it
 
tend
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
than
 
GSEP
 
and
 
MDX-UVR
 
inst3/464
 
and
 
HQ_3
 
(not
 
always,
 
though),
 
and
 
6
 
stem
 
has
 
more
 
bleeding
 
than
 
4
 
stem,
 
but
 
not
 
so
 
much
 
like
 
the
 
old
 
mdx_extra
 
4
 
stem
 
model).
  -  Models  ensemble in  UVR5  GUI  ( one  of  the  best  results  so  far  for  both  instrumentals  and  vocals  SDR-wise).  Decent  Nvidia  GPU  required,  or  brace  for  4  hours  processing  on  2/4  Sandy  Bridge  per  whole  ensemble  of  one  song.  How  to  set  up  ensemble  video.
