    The  reason  why  it  works  best  is  that  it  does  not  destroy  the  sound  of  any  of  the  present  
outputs
 
compared
 
to
 
Max_Spec
 
and
 
Min_Spec
  The  2  algorithms  still  have  potential  for  testing,  though."    More  on  how  the  ensemble  in  UVR  works   "Max  takes  the  highest  values  between  each  separation  to  create  the  new  one  (fuller  
sounding,
 
more
 
bleed).
 Min  takes  the  lowest  values  between  each  separation  to  create  the  new  one  (filtered  
sounding,
 
less
 
bleed).
 Avg  is  the  average  of  each  separation."   “[E.g.]  HQ  1  would  be  better  if  the  ensemble  algorithm  worked  how  I  thought  it  did.   It  was  explained  to  me  that  [ensemble  algorithm]  tries  to  find  common  frequencies  across  all  
the
 
outputs
 
and
 
combines
 
them
 
into
 
the
 
result,
 
which
 
to
 
me
 
doesn't
 
actually
 
seem
 
to
 
happen
 
when
 
HQ1
 
manages
 
to
 
bring
 
vocals
 
to
 
the
 
mix
 
in
 
an
 
8
 
model
 
ensemble,
 
how
 
is
 
it
 
not
 
like
 
"okay
 
A
 
those
 
are
 
vocals,
 
and
 
B
 
you're
 
the
 
only
 
model
 
bringing
 
those
 
frequencies
 
to
 
me
 
trying
 
to
 
imply
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
vocals"
 
and
 
discard
 
them.
 
I
 
mean
 
I
 
am
 
running
 
max/max,
 
but
 I  swear  all  avg/avg  and  min/min  do  is  lower  the  volumes  [see  enemble  in  DAW],  It's  hard  to  know  without  days  of  testing”  “If  u  try  avg/avg  it  will  get  quite  muddy  on  instr  result  than  max/max.  But  some  song  if  you  
put
 
kim
 
vocal
 
1
 
will
 
get
 
vocal
 
residue
 
on
 
the
 
result”.
  4-5  max  ensemble  models  rule   Q:  Why  I  shouldn’t  use  more  than  4-5  models  for  UVR  ensemble  (in  most  cases)  A:  It's  easier  to  get,  when  you  separate  the  same  song  using  some  models.  Get  the  best  4-5  
models
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
recommended
 
currently,
 
plus
 
make
 
some
 
more
 
separations,
 
using
 
some
 
random
 
ones.
 
Then
 
try
 
to
 
reflect
 
avg
 
spec
 
from
 
UVR
 
by
 
importing
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
results
 
to
 
your
 
DAW.
  You'll  do  it  by  decreasing  volume  by  3dB  per  one  stem,  so  for  a  pair  you  need  to  decrease  
the
 
volume
 
of
 
two
 
stems
 
by
 
6dB
 
(possibly
 
6.02
 
as
 
well).
 
Decrease
 
the
 
volume
 
by
 
the
 
same
 
value
 
further
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
a
 
pair
 
for
 
all
 
stems
 
accordingly,
 
so
 
you'll
 
get
 
pretty
 
much
 
similar
 
result
 
like
 
avg
 
spec
 
in
 
UVR.
  You  can  also  maybe  apply  a  limiter  on  the  master.  In  the  second  variant,  manipulate  the  
volume
 
of
 
all
 
stems
 
by
 
your
 
taste
 
instead
 
of
 
keeping
 
the
 
same
 
volume.
 
By
 
this
 
process,
 
you
 
can
 
observe
 
that
 
the
 
more
 
results
 
imported
 
above
 
4-5
 
results,
 
the
 
worse
 
result
 
you
 
have
 
when
 
you
 
don't
 
decrease
 
volume
 
of
 
worse
 
results.
 
When
 
you
 
have
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
single
 
results,
 
you'll
 
end
 
up
 
decreasing
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
bad
 
results
 
(or
 
deleting
 
them
 
completely).
 
You
 
don't
 
have
 
this
 
opportunity
 
in
 
UVR
 
using
 
avg
 
spec
 
-
 
so
 
like
 
in
 
the
 
first
