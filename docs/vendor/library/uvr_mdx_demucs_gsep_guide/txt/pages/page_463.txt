    drumsep  sometimes  it's  better,  sometimes  it's  not.  Versus  MDX23  Colab  V2,  instrumentals  
sometimes
 
sound
 
much
 
worse,
 
so
 
rather
 
don’t
 
bother
 
for
 
instrumentals.
 
USS-Bytedance  (any;  esp.  SFX)  https://github.com/bytedance/uss (COMMAND:  "conda  install  -c  intel  icc_rt"  SOLVES  the  LLVM  ERROR)   You  provide  e.g.  a  sample  of  any  instrument  or  SFX,  and  the  AI  separates  it  solo  from  a  
song
 
or
 
movie
 
fragment
 
you
 
choose
 
to
 
separate.
  It  works  in  mono.  You  need  to  process  right  and  left  channel  separately.   Update  29.04.25  (Python  No  such  file  or  directory  fix;  thx  epiphery)  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rfl0YJt7cwxdT_pQlgobJNuX3fANyYmx?usp=sharing  (old)  ByteDance  USS  with  Colab  by  jazzpear94  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lRjlsqeBhO9B3dvW4jSWanjFLd6tuEO9?usp=share_link  (old)  Probably  mirror  (fixed  March  2024):  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f2qUITs5RR6Fr3MKfQeYaaj9ciTz93B2 errors  out  with:  “sed:  can't  read  /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/uss/config.py:  No  such  file  or  
directory”)
 
(2025)
  It  works  (much)  better  than  zero-shot  (not  only  “user-friendly  wise”).   Better  results,  and  It  divides  them  into  many  categories.   Great  for  isolating  SFX',  worse  for  vocals  than  current  vocal  models.  Even  providing  acapella  
didn't
 
give
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
current
 
instrumental
 
models.
 
It
 
just
 
serves
 
well
 
for
 
other
 
purposes.
