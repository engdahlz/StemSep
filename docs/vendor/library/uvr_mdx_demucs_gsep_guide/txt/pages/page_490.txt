    Versions  “2022.01.21.1”  and  ”1.2.1.9”  need  to  be  updated  to  newer  versions,  they  stopped  
working
 
entirely.
 
  (not  needed  anymore,  as  current  should  still  work)  You  can  alternatively  grab  this  recompiled  version  by  another  user.  By  these  downloaders  you  can  easily  download  whole  albums  including  hi-res  and  in  GUI  
(PRO),
 
and
 
also
 
queue
 
for
 
single
 
tracks
 
to
 
download
 
automatically
 
is
 
available
 
(Pro).
 
  There  are  cases  when  certain  songs  are  behind  regional  block,  and  won’t  be  downloaded  by  
any
 
Divolt
 
or
 
Discord
 
bot
 
resulting
 
in
 
error.
 
 In  such  a  case,  you’ll  need  the  above  downloader  used  locally,  along  with  a  Hi-Fi  Plus  
subscription
 
bought
 
for
 
your
 
localization.
 
Accounts
 
bought
 
from
 
elsewhere,
 
or
 
paid
 
with
 
foreign
 
currency,
 
will
 
most
 
likely
 
have
 
regional
 
block
 
for
 
some
 
other
 
country,
 
so
 
after
 
you
 
log
 
into
 
the
 
service,
 
certain
 
songs
 
won’t
 
show
 
in
 
search,
 
so
 
the
 
only
 
way
 
to
 
show
 
them
 
without
 
proper
 
account
 
(at
 
least
 
for
 
your
 
region)
 
is
 
to
 
log
 
out
 
from
 
regional
 
locked
 
account,
 
start
 
new
 account,  and  visit:  https://listen.tidal.com/ (you  don’t  need  to  have  a  valid  subscription  to  search  for  songs  on  Tidal).   Besides  trial,  you  can  go  for  Tidal  Hi-Fi  cheap  subscription  to:  https://www.hotukdeals.com/vouchers/tidal.com or  pepper.pl or  mydealz.de which  always  have  some  free  or  almost  free  giveaways  (linked  to  a  ready  search).  Then  install  the  desktop  
Tidal
 
app
 
and
 
log
 
in
 
and
 
open
 
the
 
downloader.
 
It
 
might
 
automate
 
the
 
login
 
process
 
in
 
the
 
downloader
 (if  you  need  to  switch  an  account,  you  better  delete  Tidal-GUI  folder  from  your  documents  
folder
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
any
 
problems).
 
Monthly
 
Argentinian
 
subscription
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
reliable
 
solution
 
now
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
want
 
to
 
change
 
your
 
account
 
every
 
month
 
or
 
two
 
searching
 
for
 
new
 
offers.
  Tidal  over  some  other  streaming  services  has  some  tracks  in  master  quality  which  is  24  bit,  
and
 
it
 
gives
 
better
 
results
 
for
 
separation
 
as
 
the
 
dynamics
 
are
 
usually
 
better.
 
But
 
check
 
if
 
your
 
downloaded
 
file
 
is
 
really
 
a
 
24
 
bit
 
and
 
your
 
downloader
 
is
 
configured
 
properly
 
(read
 
the
 
documentation
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
any
 
issues).
  But,  on  Tidal  there  are  were  some  fake  master  files  in  the  past,  which  in  reality  were  16  bits,  
and
 
they’re
 
MQA
 
to
 
save
 
space
 
on
 
their
 
servers
 
or
 
mislead
 
people,
 
so
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
benefit
 
from
 
using
 
them
 
vs
 
Audio
 
CD
 
16
 
bit
 
rip,
 
since
 
MQA
 
alters
 
quality
 
in
 
higher
 
frequencies
 
(only)
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
have
 
an
 
influence
 
on
 
separation
 
process.
 
So
 
to
 
verify
 
if
 
your
 
downloader
 
is
 
set
 
up
 
properly,
 
check
 
whether
 
you
 
can
 
download
 
any
 
track
 
from
 
Music
 
To
 
be
 
Murdered
 
By,
 
by
 
Eminem
 
in
 
24
 
bit.
 
If
 
you
 
can,
 
you
 
have
 
properly
 
installed
 
and
 
authorized
 
the
 
downloader,
 
so
 
it
 
can
 
download
 
24
 
bit
 
files
 
or
 
at
 
a
 
higher
 
sample
 
rate
 
than
 
44kHz
 
if
 
available.
 
  You  can  paste  links  from  Tidal  into  the  GUI  browser  to  find  that  track.  Just  delete  “?u”  at  the  
end
 
of
 
the
 
shared
 
link.
