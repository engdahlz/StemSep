    -  Bandlab  Splitter (4-6  stem  -  guitar,  piano,  web  and  iOS/Android  app)  -  previously  could  be  used  e.g.  for  cleaning  stems  from  other  services,  48kHz  output,  stems  can  be  misaligned,  
the
 
quality
 
got
 
worse
 
since
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
updates
 
(rather
 
not
 
worth
 
using
 
anymore)
 -  Audioshake (paid,  only  non-copyrightes  music,  or  slowed  down  songs  [see  workaround  in  "paid"  above])  -  sometimes  better  results  than  Demucs  ft  model.  -  Spectralayers  10  -  mainly  for  bass  and  drum  separation  -  “I  think  I've  got  some  really  comparable  samples  out  of  jarredou's  MDX23  Colab  fork”,  but  for  
vocals
 
and
 
instrumentals
 
it’s
 
mediocre
 
[in
 
Spectralayers
 
10].
 -  music.ai  -  “Bass  was  a  fair  bit  better  than  Demucs  HT,  Drums  about  the  same.  Guitars  were  
very
 
good
 
though.
 
Vocal
 
was
 
almost
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
my
 
cleaned
 
up
 
work.
 
(...)
 
I'd
 
say
 
a
 
little
 
clearer
 
than
 
MVSEP
 
4
 
ensemble.
 
It
 
seems
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
instrument
 
bleed
 
out
 
quite
 
well,
 
(...)
 
An
 
engineer
 
I've
 
worked
 
with
 
demixed
 
to
 
almost
 
the
 
same
 
results,
 
it
 
took
 
me
 
a
 
few
 
hours
 
and
 
achieve
 
it
 
[in]
 
39
 
seconds”

 -  dango.ai  (https://tuanziai.com/en-US)  -  also  has  4  or  more  stems  separation  (expensive)  -  (old)  MDX23  1.0  by  ZFTurbo  4  stems  (Colab,  desktop  app,  as  above,  much  cleaner  vs  
demucs_ft,
 
less
 
aggressive,
 
but
 
in
 
1.0
 
more
 
low
 
volume
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
completely
 
quiet
 
places
 
in
 
instrumentals
 
vs
 
e.g.
 
HQ_3,
 
instrumentals
 
as
 
input
 
should
 
sound
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
v.
 
2.4
 
fork
 
as
 
only
 
4
 
stem
 
separation
 
code
 
didn’t
 
change
 
much
 
since
 
then)
   -  MVSEP  has  also  single  piano,  guitar  and  bass  models  (in  many  cases,  guitar  model  can  
pick
 
up
 
piano
 
better
 
than
 
piano
 
model;
 "works  great  for  songs  with  grand  piano,  but  only  grand  piano,  since  that’s  what  it  was  
trained
 
on.
 Same  with  guitar,  which  catches  more  piano  than  piano  model  does,  ironically").   -  x-minus/uvronline.app  has  also  single  acoustic  and  guitar  models  by  viperx   -  viperx’  piano  model  is  also  on  x-minus/uvronline.app.  (More  on  piano  and  guitar  models  later  below)   To  enhance  4  stem  results,  you  can  use  good  instrumental  obtained  from  other  source  as  input  for  the  above  (before  instrumental  Roformers  it  could  be  e.g.  KaraFan,  and  its  different  presets  ensembled  in  UVR5  app  with  Audio  Tools>Manual  Ensemble)   For  the  best  results  for  piano  or  guitar  models,  use  other  stem  from  4  stems  from  e.g.  
“Ensemble
 
8
 
models”
 
or
 
MDX23
 
Colab
 
or
 
htdemucs_ft
 
as
 
input.
   Moises.ai  -  although  drums  might  be  better  using  e.g.  “MVSep  Drums”  already,  probably  vs  
Mel-Roformer
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
or
 
x-minus
 
(not
 
sure)
 
[Moises]
 
can
 
give
 
“better
 
results
 
(...)
 
if
 
the
 
input
 
material
 
is
 
for
 
example
 
cassette-tape
 
sourced
 
or
 
post-FM).
  FL  Studio  -  rather  nothing  better  than  the  solutions  above
