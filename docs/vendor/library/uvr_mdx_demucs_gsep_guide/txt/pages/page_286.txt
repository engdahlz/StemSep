    The  question  is:  how  long  do  you  wanna  wait  vs.  quality  (SDR-based  quality,  tho)”   In  UVR  and  Not  Eddy’s  Colabs  you  can  change  segment  size  from  512  to  32  in  order  to  
possibly
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
with
 
some
 
older
 
models
 
like
 
e.g.
 
D1581
 
(but
 
it
 
tremendously
 
increases
 
separation
 
time).
  For  lack  of  spectrum  above  14.7kHz   E.g.  in  such  ensemble:  5_HP-Karaoke-UVR,  6_HP-Karaoke-UVR,  UVR-MDX-NET  Karaoke,  UVR-MDX-NET  
Karaoke
 
2
 
 Set  Max  Spec/Max  Spec  instead  of  Min  Spec/Min  Spec,  and  also  hi-end  process  (both  need  
to
 
be
 
enabled
 
for
 
fuller
 
spectrum).
 Karaoke  models  are  not  full  band,  even  VR  ones  are  17.7kHz  and  MDX  are  14.7kHz  IRC.  
Setting
 
Max
 
Spec
 
with
 
hi-end
 
process
 
will
 
give
 
around
 
21kHz
 
output
 
in
 
this
 
case.
  Cutoff  with  min  spec  in  narrowband  models  is  a  feature  introduced  at  some  point  in  UVR5  
GUI
 
for
 
even
 
single
 
MDX
 
models
 
in
 
general,
 
and
 
doesn't
 
exist
 
in
 
CLI
 
version.
 
It's
 
to
 
filter
 
out
 
some
 
noise
 
in
 
e.g.
 
instrumental
 
from
 
inversion.
 
Cutoff
 
then
 
matches
 
model
 
training
 
frequency
 
(in
 
CLI
 
MDX,
 
vocal
 
model
 
after
 
inversion
 
with
 
mixture
 
gives
 
full
 
band
 
instrumental).
 
Also,
 
similar
 
filtering/cutoff
 
is
 
done
 
in
 
ensemble
 
with
 
min
 
spec.
  More  settings  explanation   Leaving  both  shifts  and  overlap  default  vs  shifts  10  decreases  SDR  by  only  0.01  SDR  in  
ensemble,
 
but
 
processing
 
time
 
is
 
much
 
faster
 
-
 
1.7x
 
for
 
each
 
shift.
 
Also,
 
0.75
 
overlap
 
increases
 
SDR
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
a
 
single
 
model
 
when
 
even
 
shift
 
is
 
set

   It  takes  around  1  hour  36  minutes  on  a  GTX  1080  Ti  for  100  1-minute  files.   “And  18  hours  on  i5-2410M  @2.8  for  5:04  track.   Rating  1  Ensemble  on  a  7-min  song  to  compare.   Time  elapsed:  1080Ti  =  5m45s  =  345s  =  100%  4070Ti  =  4m49s  =  289s  =  83,8%  4070Ti  =  ~16%  faster   1080Ti  =  ~€250  (2nd  hand)  4070Ti  =  €909  (new)   Conclusion:  for  every  1%  gain  in  performance,  u  pay  €41  extra  (€659  extra  in  total).”  Bas
