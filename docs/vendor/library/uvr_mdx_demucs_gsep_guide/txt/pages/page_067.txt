     -  Two  weeks  ago,  unwa  and  97chris  released  a  bleed  suppressor Mel  Roformer  model  dedicated  for  instrumentals  (made  with  unwa  v1  in  mind).  It  can  work  with  e.g.  v1  and  v1e.  Sometimes  it  can  remove  some  bleed  also  after  using  phase  fixer (by  becruily)  dedicated  for  v1  model,  or  used  also  on  x-minus  for  premium  users  
 -  Anjok  released a  new  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #6  UVR_Patch_11_25_24_1_48_BETA  (Windows:  standalone |  patch |  Mac:  M1 | x86-64)  addressing  “All  stem”  error  issue  with  viperx’  models.   And  with  it,  a  long  anticipated  MDX-Net  HQ_5  model  has  been  released  |  Colab |  MVSEP  (it’s  also  added  to  Download  Center  in  previous  UVR  patch  versions).  
New
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
HQ_5
 
model
 
is
 
announced
 
to
 
be
 
released
 
in
 
two
 
weeks
 
already.
 
Instrumentals
 
are
 
slightly
 
muddier
 
than
 
in
 
HQ_4,
 
but
 
vocal
 
residues
 
are
 
also
 
a
 
bit
 
quieter
 
(although
 
rather
 
still
 
present
 
where
 
they
 
were
 
before,
 
maybe
 
with
 
some
 
exceptions).
 
 E.g.  some  hi  hats  might  get  a  tad  quieter  in  the  mix.  
The
 
new
 
model
 
variant
 
in
 
two
 
weeks
 
was
 
said
 
to
 
have
 
fuller
 
instrumentals.
 
 
vs
 
unwa’s
 
v1e
 
“HQ5
 
has
 
less
 
bleed
 
but
 
is
 
prone
 
to
 
dips
 
in
 
certain
 
situations.
 
(...).
 
Unwa
 
has
 
more
 
stability,
 
but
 
the
 
faint
 
bleed
 
is
 
more
 
audible.
 
So
 
I'd
 
say
 
it's
 
situational.
 
Use
 
both.
 
(...)
 
Splice
 
the
 
two
 
into
 
one
 
track
 
depending
 
on
 
which
 
part
 
works
 
better
 
in
 
whichever
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
song
 
is
 
what
 
I'd
 
do.”

from

no
 
longer
 
working
 
(since

in
 
newer

Sadly,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
them
 
(don’t
 
restore
 
their
 
files
 
manually)
 
or
 
the
 
ensemble
 
will
 
not
 
work
 
and
 
model
 
choice
 
will
 
be
 
greyed
 
out.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
start
 
from
 
scratch.
 
 -  Sucial  released  a  new  Mel-Roformer  dereverb/echo  model  (model |  MVSEP).  It’s  good  but  doesn’t  seem  to  be  better  than  the  more  aggresive  variant  of  Mel  anvuew's  model  (models  list).  Still,  might  depend  on  a  use  case.
