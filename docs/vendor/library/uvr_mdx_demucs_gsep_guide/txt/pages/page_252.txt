  -  USS-ByteDance (for  providing  any,  at  least,  proper  sample)  -  Zero  Shot (currently  worse  for  SFX  vs  Bytedance)  -  Audiosep -  custom  stem  separation  on  Dango  (paid,  10  seconds  for  free)   -  DNR  Demucs  4  model  (repo:  CDX23 repo,  MVSEP,  Colab)  -  it  used  to  output  fake  stereo  (at  least  training  dataset  was  mono).  "I  noticed  [it]  doesn't  do  well  and  doesn't  detect  water  sounds,  and  fire  sounds"  Can  be  used  in  UVR  (the  three  stems  will  be  labelled  wrong,  SFX  will  be  bass).  >For  UVR,  download  the  model  files,  put  them  in  the  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\Demucs_Models\v3_v4_repo,  Delete  "97d170e1-"   from  all  the  three  file  names,  copy  this  yaml alongside  the  model  files  (it  won’t  work  on  AMD  4GB  VRAM  GPUs).  >The  Colab  might  run  occasionally  on  CPU,  and  then  it  might  be  slow  to  the  point  that  it

 -  jazzpear’s  MDX23C  model  (files)  -   rename  the  config  to  .yaml  as  UVR  GUI  doesn't  read  .yml.  You  put  config  in  UVR’s  models\mdx_net_models\model_data\mdx_c_configs.  Then  
when
 
you
 
use
 
it
 
in
 
UVR
 
it'll
 
ask
 
you
 
for
 
params,
 
so
 
you
 
locate
 
the
 
newly
 
placed
 
config
 
file.

 If  it’s  not  available  for  paid  users  of  uvronline.app,  use  this link  |  MVSEP  |  model  files:  Less  aggressive &  More  aggressive |  yaml  file |  UVR  Roformer  patch |  Colab  -  myxt.com  (uses  Audioshake)  -  AudioSep (you  can  try  it  to  get  e.g.  birds  SFX  and  then  use  as  a  source  to  debleed  or  maybe  try  to  invert  phase  and  cancel  out)
