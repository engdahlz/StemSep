and
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
option
 
selected
 
in
 
the
 
GUI
 
with:
 use_InstVoc_  =  '--use_InstVoc'  #forced  use  use_BSRoformer_  =   '--use_BSRoformer'  #forced  use  use_Kim_MelRoformer_  =   '--use_Kim_MelRoformer'  #forced  use   use_VOCFT_  =  '--use_VOCFT'  if  use_VOCFT  is  True  else  ''  use_VitLarge_  =  '--use_VitLarge'  if  use_VitLarge  is  True  else  ''  use_InstHQ4_  =  '--use_InstHQ4'  if  use_InstHQ4  is  True  else  ''  restore_gain  =  '--restore_gain'  if  restore_gain_after_separation  is  True  else  ''  vocals_only  =  '--vocals_only'  if  Separation_mode  ==  'Vocals/Instrumental'  else  ''  filter_vocals  =  '--filter_vocals'  if  filter_vocals_below_50hz  is  True  else  ''    Q:  So  you  don't  need  to  use  them?  Only  using  the  ones  with  the  two  --  before  right   A:  For  example,  if  you  want  to  activate  vocals  filtering  below  50hz,  you  add   "--filter_vocals"  
to
 
the
 
command
 
line
  Q:  How  do  you  do  this  A:  (click)  Q:  oh  yeah  I  just  have  to  change  the  default  number  then  right  It  works  #  general   A:  If  you  have  multiple  GPUs  and  the  CUDA  one  is  not  labelled  device  "0",  maybe  that  can  
be
 
the
 
cause
 
too,
 
it's
 
hardcoded
 
for
 
Colab,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
change
 
it
 
in
 
first
 
lines
 
of
 
inference.py
 
file
 
gpu_use
 
=
 
"0"
 
  If  your  GPU  is  not  detected  in  Anaconda,  use  Python  (can  be  3.12).  If  it's  the  same:   https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally  Where  it  says  "run  this  command"  I  basically  uninstalled  the  modules  it  had  in  there  so  I  did  pip  uninstall  torch  torchvision  torchaudio  then  ran  that  command  to  install  it
