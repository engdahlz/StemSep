    Once  you  mount  GDrive,  open  file  manager  on  the  left,  right  click>copy  path>paste  in  the  
first

for
 
the
 
second
 
file
 
in
 
the

field
 
and
 
so
 
on
 
and
 
so
 
forth.

you
 
can
 
change

   Possible  fixes  for  the  errors   -  Don’t  use  spaces  in  output  file  name   -  “AttributeError:  module  'numpy'  has  no  attribute  'float'   np.float  was  a  deprecated  alias  for  the  builtin  float.”
