    *b)  You  might  still  have  SageAttention  not  found  error.  Perform  the  following:  “Had  to  replace  cufft64_10.dll  from

(bratmix)
  -  Google  broke  installing  dependencies  in  many  Colabs.  For  the  inference  Colab  by  jarredou,  see  here for  troubleshooting  (pushed  the  changes  -  not  tested,  might  be  useful  for  other  Colabs;  fixed).  In  the  case  of  AudioSR,  use  huggingface.   -  NVIDIA  released  their  own  audio  upscaler,  with  also  an  ability  of  inpainting  (so  it  can  fill  
short
 
silences
 
between
 
damaged
 
segments
 
of
 
audio).
 https://github.com/NVIDIA/diffusion-audio-restoration But  maybe  don’t  try  it  out  the  upscaler  just  yet,  as  the  code  is  currently  so  messy  and  difficult  
to
 
deploy

on
 
MacOS,
 
that
 
it
 
took
 
9
 
hours
 
for
 
two

users,
 
and
 
they
 
still
 
didn't
 
succeed
 
even
 
with
 
help
 
of
 
AI
 
chats.
 
And
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
work
 
on
 
Colab,
 
the
 
code
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
completely
 
rewritten,
 
jarredou
 
says.
  -  mesk  released  a  beta  version  of  his  metal  Mel-Roformer  fine-tune  instrumental  model

“Rifforge”

more

 “training  is  still  in  progress,  that's  why  it's  a  beta  test  of  the  model;  It  should  work  fine  for  a  lot

(at
