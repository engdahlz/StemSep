    Go  to  options:>Advanced  MDX-Net  options>Enable  Demudder  Then  you  can  pick  what  Demudder  variant  you  want  and  it  will  be  used  in  every  separation  
using
 
MDX-Net
 
models.
  
Demudder
 
consists
 
of
 
three
 
methods
 
to
 
choose
 
from:
 
 -  Phase  Rotate  -  Phase  Remix  (Similar  to  X-Minus)  -  “the  fullest  sounding,  but  can  leave  a  lot  of  
artifacts
 
with
 
certain
 
models.
 
I
 
only
 
recommend
 
that
 
method
 
for
 
the
 
muddiest
 
models.
 
Otherwise,
 
Combined
 
Methods
 
is
 
the
 
best”
 
“I
 
don't
 
recommend
 
using
 
phase
 
remix
 
on
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
v1e
 
model.
 
I
 
recommend
 
combined
 
methods
 
or
 
phase
 
rotate
 
for
 
models
 
produce
 
fuller
 
instrumentals.”

 -  Combine  Methods  (weighted  mix  of  the  final  instrumentals  generated  by  the  above).  More  in  the  full  changelog.  -  You  can  also  use  phase  remix  in  SESA Colab   Demudder  is  “meant  to  solely  target  instrumentals.  The  vocals  should  stay  exactly  as  
before.”
 “It  works  best  on  tracks  that  are  spectrally  dense  (ex.  Metal,  Rock,  Alternative,  EDM,  etc.)  I  don't  recommend  it  for  acoustic  or  light  tracks.  I  don't  recommend  using  it  with  models  that  emphasize  fuller  instrumentals  (like  Unwa's  v1e  
model).”

“I've
 
noticed
 
with
 
the
 
few
 
amounts
 
of
 
tracks
 
I've
 
tried,
 
demudding
 
can
 
sometimes
 
accentuate
 instances  of  bleeding  or  otherwise  entirely  missed  vocal-like  sounds”.  More  in  the  full  changelog.  “I  put  the  demudded  instrumental  in  the  bleed  suppressor,  and  it  sounds  really  good,  almost  
noise
 
free.
 
I
 
either
 
do
 
a
 
bleed
 
suppressor
 
or
 
a
 
V1/bleed
 
suppressor
 
ensemble”

“I
 
found
 
that
 
Phase
 
Remix
 
also
 
works
 
well
 
on
 
pop
 
and
 
other
 
genres
 
of
 
music,
 
but
 
it
 
only
 
works
 
using

 “I  do  plan  on  adding  options  to  tweak  the  phase  rotation.  I  also  plan  on  adding  another  combination  method  that  may  work  better  on  certain  tracks.”

 If  you  set  64-bit  float  output  in  Options>Additional  settings,  the  results  might  be  slightly  less  
muddy,
 
but
 
also
 
in
 
very
 
big
 
size.
