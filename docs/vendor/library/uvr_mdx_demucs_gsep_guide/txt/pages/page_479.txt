     2)   Utagoe (English  version  with  guide  and  error  messages  translated  by  Anjok)  -  if  the  invert  isn't  good,  then  try  utagoe,  but  it’s  not  the  best.   Settings  for  Utagoe  by  HV:  “if  your  tracks  don't  invert  perfectly”  (even  when  aligned)  https://imgur.com/a/ZC14xlE “if  it's  perfectly  inverting”:  https://imgur.com/a/Qb4pKeX Some  other  settings:  https://imgur.com/a/fvQwbMO  “It  has  a  weird  issue  sometimes  tho,  even  when  everything  is  perfectly  aligned  and  inverts  
perfectly,
 
utagoe
 
misses
 
some
 
places,
 
and
 
it
 
won’t
 
insert
 
for
 
a
 
second
 
or
 
so”

 https://imgur.com/a/kSDrTAB Going  higher  than  1.3  [of  extractable  level]  imo  won't  do  good  at  cleaning.  Additional  tip  too,  
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
just
 
an
 
"invert"
 
and
 
"keep
 
the
 
original
 
vocal
 
volume"
 
just
 
choose
 
"by
 
waveform”.
  I  have  been  using  Utagoe  for  inversions  recently  because  it  keeps  the  original  volume  of  the  
vocals,
 
and
 
then
 
I
 
ran
 
it
 
on
 
UVR
 
or
 
MDX.
 
If
 
the
 
chunks
 
are
 
soft,
 
I
 
prefer
 
using
 
UVR
 
but
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
chunks
 
are
 
that
 
heavy
 
like
 
drums,
 
I'd
 
use
 
MDX.
 Also,  I  find  it  better  to  clean  an  invert  via  UVR  or  MDX  than  Utagoe  because  it's  better  and  
cleaner
 
without
 
destroying
 
the
 
vocals“
 
  -  “When  using  Utagoe,  or  UVR5,  for  aligning  inputs,  and  inverting  them,  I  get  this  really  
strange
 
cracking
 
noise,
 
that
 
not
 
even
 
doing
 
a
 
vocal
 
separation
 
with
 
AI
 
later
 
can
 
get
 
rid
 
of.
 
Anyone
 
know
 
what
 
could
 
possibly
 
be
 
causing
 
this?
  So,  I  actually  found  a  solution  to  this,  for  anyone  running  into  a  similar  issue.  With  inversions  like  this,  you're  already  gonna  have  to  use  AI  to  get  rid  of  the  left  over  noise,  
since
 
it's
 
not
 
gonna
 
be
 
a
 
perfect
 
inversion.
 
So,
 
the
 
solution
 
isn't
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
perfect
 
one,
 
it's
 
simply
 
to
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
the
 
noise
 
that
 
the
 
AI
 
cannot
 
recognize,
 
right?
 With  this  particular  inversion,  I  originally  was  using  really  compressed  MP3s  from  around  
2007
 
for
 
the
 
instrumentals,
 
because
 
the
 
lossless
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
instrumentals
 
were
 
lost
 
media,
 
up
 
until
 
a
 
few
 
months
 
ago.
 I  thought  it  was  odd,  because  i  don't  remember  this  noise  being  an  issue  with  the  MP3s,  and  
that's
 
when
 
it
 
hit
 
me,
 
MP3s
 
cut
 
off
 
the
 
noise,
 
with
 
compression,
 
and
 
added
 
just
 
a
 
small
 
bit
 
more
 
of
 
that
 
noise
 
you
 
get
 
with
 
imperfect
 
inversions.
