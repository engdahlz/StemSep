    Free  Demucs  3  has  a  much  better  SDR  for  drums  and  bass  than  Audioshake,  however  the  SDR for  vocals  and  others  is  worse.   It  accepts  only  non-copyrighted  music  for  separations,  but  you  can  slow  it  down  to  
circumvent
 
it
 
(some
 
music
 
like
 
K-Pop
 
BTS
 
is
 
not
 
detected)
 
but
 
changing
 
speed
 
to
 
110%
 
yields
 
better
 
results,
 
even
 
vs
 
reversing
 
the
 
track.
  Upload  limit  is  one  minute,  so  theoretically  you  can  cut  and  merge  chunks,  but  AS  will  fade  
out
 
each
 
chunk,
 
so
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
find
 
specific
 
overhead
 
to
 
begin
 
every
 
next
 
chunk
 
with,
 
to
 
merge
 
chunks
 
seamlessly
 
(I
 
don’t
 
remember
 
if
 
it
 
solves
 
the
 
problem
 
of
 
AS
 
watermark,
 
though).
 Then,  you  can  download  preview  (chunk)  for  free  using  similar  method  like  described  in  
allflac
 
section
 
(Chrome
 
Dev
 
Tools
 
->
 
Network
 
->
 
Set
 
filter
 
to
 
amazon)
 
but
 
result
 
file
 
is
 
unfortunately
 
only
 
128kbps
 
mp3.
  They  are  now  limiting  how  many  audio  files  you  can  upload  to  preview,  but  that  can  easily  be  
mitigated
 
by
 
just
 
using
 
a
 
temporary
 
email
 
provider
 
or
 
adding
 
“+1”
 
or
 
“+2”
 
or
 
“.”
 
to
 
your
 
gmail
 
address,
 
so
 
you
 
will
 
still
 
receive
 
your
 
email
 
e.g.
 
y.o.u.r.m.a.i.l.@gmail.com
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
Google
 
as
 
yourmail@gmail.com.
  You  can  also  ping  Smudge,  Baul  Plart  or  Bas  Curtiz  in  #request-separation  to  isolate  some  
song
 
to
 
make
 
this
 
all
 
easily
 
just
 
for
 
you

-
 
at
 
least
 
the
 
Bas’
 
tool
 
stopped
 
working,
 
so
 
the
 
rest
 
like
 
AS
 
Tool
 
might
 
be
 
dead
 
too
 
-
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
API
 
access,
 
not
 
sure).
   
Lalal.ai  7  stem   Acoustic  and  electric  guitar  models,  piano,  bass,  drums  and  vocal  with  instrumental  (for  2  
stem
 
UVR/MDX
 
should
 
do
 
the
 
job
 
better)
 Online  service  with  10  minutes/50MB  per  file  limitation  per  free  user.   Now  they  have  some  voc/inst  models  sounding  like  some  ensemble  of  public  Roformers,  but  
still
 
not
 
as
 
good,
 
but
 
close.
 
Some
 
specific
 
models
 
are
 
worth
 
trying
 
out,
 
e.g.
 
lead
 
guitars
 
-
 
the
 
model
 
got
 
better
 
by
 
the
 
time
 
or
 
piano
 
model.
  Older  notes:  “I  love  Demucs  3,  although  for  some  specific  songs  (with  a  lot  of  percussion  and  loops)  I  still  
find
 
lalal
 
better.
 Demucs  is  great  at  keeping  punchy  drums,  for  example  hip-hop,  rap,  house  etc  songs”   “lalal  is[n’t]  worth  it  anymore,  most  of  their  models  like  strings  or  synths  are  crap  and  don't  
work
 
at
 
all”
