     PS.  In  the  late  2025  we  received  an  info  about  Apple  Music  rejecting  Atmos  mixes  of  some  
legacy
 
music
 
made
 
with
 
separation
 
models
 
(ensembles,
 
and
 
then
 
probably
 
some
 
for
 
4-6
 
stems),
 
even
 
though
 
the
 
mixes
 
sounded
 
good,
 
and
 
were
 
accepted
 
by
 
labels
 
and
 
artists.
 
Also,
 
we
 
know
 
that
 
these
 
separation
 
methods
 
worked
 
fine
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
some
 
other
 
engineers.
 
We
 
suspect
 
that
 
they
 
might
 
use
 
automated
 
tools
 
catching
 
specific
 
artefacts
 
usually
 
seen
 
in
 
separation
 
models
 
on
 
spectrograms
 
of
 
extracted
 
channels
 
from
 
the
 
whole
 
Atmos
 
mix.
 “I  don't  think  there's  a  need  of  really  advanced  and  expensive  method  to  detect  source  
separated
 
stems,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
time,
 
just
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
background
 
noise
 
is
 
enough
 
to
 
tell,
 original  stem  vs  separated  one  [click]  +  kind  of  "aliasing"  artifacts  and/or  dither  residues  popping  here  and  there...  There  are  lots  of  patterns  than  can  make  separated  audio  stems  identifiable,  I  don't  think  it's  
hard
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
model
 
to
 
spot
 
them
 
with
 
quite
 
good
 
accuracy
 
(even
 
if
 
not
 
really
 
audible
 
to
 
human
 
ears)”

  To  sum  up:   Tips  to  enhance  separation  Demudder in  UVR/x-minus  (increases  vocal  residues)   AI  audio  upscalers  list  AI  mastering  services  Blending  with  RVC  model  Make  your  own  remaster:   More  clarity/better  quality/general  audio  restoration  of  separated  stem(s)  Have  complete  freedom  over  the  result,  using  (among  others)  spectral  restoration  plugins  to  
demudd
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
separations
 
freely
 
with
 
plugins.
 
Then
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
the
 
result
 
further
 
with
 
e.g.
 
AI
 
upscaler
 
or
 
in
 
reverse.
  E.g.  from  plugins,  you  can  start  by  using  Thimeo  Stereo  Tool which  has  a  fantastic  re/mastering  chain  feasible  for  spectral  restoration  useful  for  instrumentals  sounding  too  filtered  from  vocals  and  lacking  clarity.  Also  use  Unchirp which  states  great  complement  to  Thimeo  Stereo  Tool,  although  focuses  more  on  already  existing  spectrum.  You  can  also  play  with  free  Airwindows  Energy/Energy2 and  Air/Air2 ( or  Air3,  MIA  Thin)  plugins  for  restoration,  and  furthermore  some  compressors  or  other  plugins  and  effects
