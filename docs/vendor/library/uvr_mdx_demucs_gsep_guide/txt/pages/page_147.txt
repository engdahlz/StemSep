    "Overlap  can  reduce/remove  artifacts  at  audio  chunks/segments  boundaries,  and  improve  a  
little
 
bit
 
the
 
results
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
the
 
shift
 
trick
 
works
 
(merging
 
multiple
 
passes
 
with
 
slightly
 
different
 
results,
 
each
 
with
 
good
 
and
 
bad).
 But  it  can't  fix  the  model  flaws  or  change  its  characteristics"   “Best  SDR  is  a  hair  more  SDR  and  a  shitload  of  more  time.   In  case  of  Voc_FT  it's  more  nuanced...  there  it  seems  to  make  a  substantial  difference  
SDR-wise.
 The  question  is:  how  long  do  u  wanna  wait  vs.  quality  (SDR-based  quality,  tho)”    -  A  script  with  guide  for  separating  multiple  speakers in  a  recording  added   -  If  you're  stuck  at  5%  of  separation  in  UVR  beta,  try  to  divide  your  audio  into  smaller  pieces  
(that's
 
beta's
 
regression)
  -  A  new  separation  site  appeared,  giving  seemingly  better  results  than  Audioshake:  https://stemz.mwm.io/ “Guitar  stem  seems  better  than  Demucs,  piano  maybe  too.  Drums  sound  like  Spleeter.  Vocal  
bleeds
 
in
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
stems,
 
or
 
not
 
vocals
 
are
 
picked
 
up,
 
so
 
they
 
end
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
synths.
 
But
 
that's
 
just
 
from

  -  Drumsep  Colab now  has  GPU  acceleration  and  much  better  max  quality  optional  settings   -  1620  MDX23C  model  added  on  x-minus.  Opposing  the  model  on  UVR,  it's  fullband  and  not  
released
 
yet
 
(16.2
 
SDR).
  "Even  if  the  separations  have  more  bleeding  than  VOC-FT  (and  it's  an  issue),  the  voice  
sound
 
itself
 
is
 
much
 
fuller,
 
"in
 
your
 
face"
 
compared
 
to
 
VOC-FT,
 
that
 
I
 
now
 
find
 
it
 
like
 
blurry
 
sounding
 
compared
 
to
 
MDXv3
 
models.
 I  think  that's  why  the  new  MDXv3  models  are  scoring  better  despite  having  more  bleeding  (at  
the
 
moment,
 
like
 
I
 
said
 
before,
 
trainers/finetuners
 
have
 
to
 
get
 
familiar
 
with
 
new
 
arch,
 
and
 
that
 
will
 
probably
 
help
 
with
 
that
 
new
 
bleed
 
issue)."
  -  New  MDX23C  model  added  on  MVSEP  (better  SDR  -  16.17)   -  UVR  beta  patch  2 repairing  no  audio  issue  with  GPU  separation  on  the  GTX  1600  series  using  MDX23C  arch.  Fixes  some  other  bugs  too.   -  Narrowband  MDX23C  vocal  model  (MDX23C_D1581  a.k.a.  model_2_stem_061321)  
trained
 
by
 
UVR
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
released.
 
SDR
 
is
 
said
 
to
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
voc_ft
 
(but
 
the
 
latter
 
was
 
evaluated
 
with
 
older
 
non-beta
 
patch).
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
CPU
 
processing
 
returns
 
errors
 
for
 
MDX23C
 
models,
 
at
 
least
 
on
 
some
 
configs
 
(“deserialize
 
model
 
on
 
CUDA”
 
error).
