    2)  deluxe  edition/reissue/remastered  (sometimes  separated  instrumentals  from  remastered  
versions
 
can
 
be
 
crispier
 
than
 
leaked
 
multitracks
 
which
 
are
 
rarely
 
even
 
mastered;
 
also,
 
different
 
remasters
 
might
 
be
 
available
 
on
 
streaming
 
platforms
 
or
 
fan-made
 
ones
 
on
 
YT
 
or
 
on
 
the
 
internet)
 3)  Video  released  for  the  song  -  although  lossy,  it  can  be  completely  different  mix  or  master  
giving
 
different
 
results
 
for
 
separation
 4)  Official  remix  -  sometimes  it  might  be  easier  to  separate  vocals  from  such  version  5)  Leaks  of  earlier  version  of  the  song  (might  have  different  mixing,  lyrics,  even  instrumental)  
-
 
YT
 
(often
 
a
 
subject
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
down),
 
fan-made
 
Discord
 
servers,
 
internet
 6)  Leaks  of  multitracks  or  stems  of  the  song  -  usually  it’s  a  different  master  than  the  final  
song,
 
but
 
you
 
might
 
experiment
 
with
 
Matchering
 
and
 
using
 
it
 
mixdown
 
without
 
vocals
 
a
 
target,
 
and
 
well
 
sounding
 
separation
 
as
 
input
 
for
 
Matchering
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
more
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
final
 
song
 7)  Leak  of  instrumental/vocals  -  it  can  be  lossy  or  slightly  different  from  the  final  song,  e.g.  
close
 
to
 
final
 
stage
 
or
 
sometimes
 
might
 
have
 
even
 
dry
 
vocals
 
without
 
any
 
effects
  Surround  versions   8)  5.1  -   e.g.  DTS  on  DVD  Audio/Blu-ray  or  SACD  (you  can  search  Discogz  to  look  for  
multichannel
 
versions
 
released
 
on
 
disks,
 
e.g.
 
whole
 
DTS
 
Entertainment
 
label)
 9)  360  Reality  or  Atmos  (7.1  or  more)  -  e.g.  on  Tidal,  Apple  Music  (how  to  download  is  
described
 
below).
  Sometimes  in  surround  releases,  vocals  can  be  there  simply  in  the  center  channel,  but  it's  
not
 
always
 
the
 
case
 
-
 
still,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
better
 
source,
 
e.g.
 
when
 
you
 
manipulate
 
with
 
volume
 
of
 
specific
 
channels,
 
or
 
for
 
vocals
 
-
 
when
 
you
 
get
 
only
 
center
 
channel
 
with
 
very
 
little
 
instrumentalization
 
which
 
may
 
turn
 
out
 
easier
 
to
 
separate
 
by
 
AI
 
(for
 
instrumental
 
you
 
might
 
possibly
 
invert
 
result
 
of
 
vocal
 
model
 
and
 
center
 
channel
 
to
 
receive
 
the
 
remain
 
instrumentalization
 
in
 
center).
  “For  me,  I  convert  left  and  right  together  then  center  alone  then  LS+Rs+LFE  together  then  I  
have
 
3
 
audio
 
filles
 
process
 
them
 
then
 
remix
 
into
 
5.1
 
again.
 The  2  are  in  stereo  and  one  mono  which  is  center:.  -  killdubo  “I  do  the  same,  except  that  I  don't  process  LFE.  Only  the  other  5.”  -   -  santilli_/Michael   E.g.  "With  the  Dolby  Atmos  release  of  Random  Access  Memories,  some  vocals  and  
instrumentals
 
can
 
be
 
separated
 
almost
 
like
 
stems"
  Or  alternatively,  you  can  simply  downmix  everything  to  stereo  and  then  separate  (just  to  
check
 
the
 
outcome
 
vs
 
regular
 
2.0
 
versions).
