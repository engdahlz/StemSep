    Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250907225920-f0bb276157-mixture.wav The  SDR  has  increased  significantly  compared  to  the  previous  MDX23C  model,  from  3.84  to  
5.41.
 
It
 
is
 
currently
 
the
 
best
 
model
 
on
 
the
 
leaderboard:
 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/leaderboard/strings/?sort=strings”  -  ZFTurbo  “From  some  quick  testing,  it  does  not  disappoint.  Still  playing  with  it,  but  atm  it's  exactly  what  
I
 
hoped
 
for.”

 “Yeah,  I’m  running  some  tests  too  with  a  few  tracks  that  were  really  hard  to  separate,  mostly  
ones
 
with
 
cellos
 
or
 
vocals
 
that
 
were
 
too
 
blended
 
with
 
the
 
strings
 
to
 
isolate
 
even
 
with
 
the
 
latest
 
inst/voc
 
models,
 
and
 
it’s
 
been
 
working
 
out
 
surprisingly
 
well.”
  -  anvuew  released  experimental  BS-Roformer  vocal  model  (nfft  4096,  stft_hop_length  1024  
“so
 
not
 
that
 
large”)
 
with
 
12
 
SDR
 
measured
 
on
 
musdb18hq
 
dataset.
 
Might
 
be
 
worth
 
checking:
 download.   11.60  SDR  on  the  same  test  set  was  previously  achieved  by  one  of  the  first  Mel-Roformers  trained  by  Bytedance  on  musdbhq  +  500  songs  (paper),  although  it  wasn't  nfft  4096.  It  uses  very  high  1024000  chunk_size  in  the  yaml,  so  consider  decreasing  it  when  having  
memory
 
issues,
 
500MB
 
ckpt
 
size.
  -  introC  released  a  python  script to  get  rid  of  vocal  leakage  in  v1e+  model   -  iZotope  released  Ozone  12.  Separation  still  has  Spleeter-like  quality,  but  “it's  unclear  what  
they
 
use”

Spleeter

disappeared
 
from

 “the  stems  sound  very  bleedy  and  not  at  all  usable”  -  becruily.  A  notable  new  feature  working  competitively  is  their  Delimiter.   -  Ableton  received  its  own  stem  separation  feature  in  Live  12.3.  It’s  made  in  cooperation  with  Moises.ai.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSahY-HGKt4 “doesn’t  even  sound  good”  -  isling  It  doesn’t  use  GPU,  and  has  a  slower  High  Quality  setting  too  (single  model  for  each  stem  
opposing
 
to
 
default
 
multi
 
stem),
 
but
 
it
 
can
 
take
 
even
 
20
 
minutes
 
for
 
1
 
minute
 
file
 
on
 
a
 
slower
 
CPU.
 
At
 
least
 
default
 
sounds
 
more
 
similar
 
to
 
Demucs
 
than
 
Roformers
 
or
 
SCNet
 
archs,
 
although
 
files
 
look
 
like
 
BS-Roformer
 
judging
 
by
 
memory
 
dump
 
(model
 
files
 
are
 
encrypted).
 Here are  the  low  default  model  stems  metrics  -  e.g.  vocals  only  8.71  SDR,  but  HQ  option  has  bigger  SDR  than  public  SCNet  weights  released  by  ZFTurbo  in  MSST  repo,  but  they're  on  a  bleedless  metric  side,  fullness  is  lower  than  in  the  public  undertrained  SCNet  XL  4  stem model.  Average  SDR  of  the  first  12  songs  in  the  multisong  dataset  vs  public  SCNet  XL:  
drums:
 
11.58
 
vs
 
11.22,
 
bass:
 
12.25
 
vs
 
11.27

 “The  boring  thing  is  that  you  have  to  launch  separation  for  each  file  manually  (no  batch  
processing).
 
To
 
nice
 
things
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
separated
 
stems
 
are
 
automatically
 
saved
 
individually
 
in
 
folder
 
(no
 
need
 
to
 
export
 
them
 
individually
 
through
 
Live's
 
rendering
 
and
 
all
 
issue
 
that
 
this
 
can
 
produce;
 
different
 
length...)”
