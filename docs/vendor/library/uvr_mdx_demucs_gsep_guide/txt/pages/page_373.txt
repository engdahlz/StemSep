    2.  “For  some  reason  when  I  use  unwa  models  it  just  like  gives  back  a  really  quiet  resampled  
version
 
of
 
whatever
 
I
 
put
 
in.”
 A:  “Check  that  you  are  using  an  up-to-date  version  of  the  repo,  IIRC,  an  edit  made  some  
months
 
ago
 
to
 
Roformers
 
code
 
was
 
creating
 
weird
 
issues
 
similar
 
to
 
this
 
for
 
some
 
people
 
and
 
was
 
removed
 
later”
 Q:  “Works  now”  Hint:  Requirements  just  for  inference  might  be  faster  to  install,  like  presented  in  the  Installation  cell  in  this Colab.   3.  For  state_dict  error  using  existing  MSST  installation,  update  MSST  to  the  last  repo  version  
with:
 !rm  -rf  /content/Music-Source-Separation-Training  !git  clone  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training  “and  you  must  reinstall  the  main  branch's  requirement.txt.  (before  it,  edit  requirements.txt  to  
remove
 
wxpython)”

 wxpython  is  for  GUI.   -  Officially  supported AMD  consumer  GPUs  for  ROCm  on  Linux  are:   RX  7900  XTX,  RX  7900  XT,  RX  7900  GRE  and  AMD  Radeon  VII  on  Ubuntu  24.04  LTS  using  
Pytorch
 
2.6
 
for
 
ROCm
 
6.3.3,
 
but
 
also
 
RX
 
9070
 
and
 
RX
 
9070
 
XT
 
and
 
RX
 
6700
 
XT
 
should
 
be
 
manageable
 
to
 
work,
 
and
 
probably
 
5700
 
XT
 
with
 
older
 
ROCm
 
version.
 -  For  RX  7900  XTX  “No  special  editing  of  the  code  was  necessary.  All  we  had  to  do  was  
install
 
a
 
ROCm-compatible
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
OS,
 
install
 
the
 
AMD
 
driver,
 
create
 
a
 
venv,
 
and
 
install
 
ROCm-compatible
 
PyTorch,
 
Torchaudio,
 
and
 
other
 
dependencies
 
on
 
it.”

  -  ROCm  7  officially  working  with  Instinct  MI350  CDNA  4  was  released,  providing  3-7x  performance  gains  over  6.0  (more).  You  can  try  your  lack  with  it  on  other  GPUs  by  e.g:   pip  install  --pre  torch  torchvision  torchaudio  --index-url  
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.0
  -  Since  then  also  ROCm  6.4.4  allowing  using  PyTorch  natively  on  Linux  and  Windows  on  RX  7000  and  9000  was  released  (more),  but  one  of  our  users  had  building  errors  with  MSST  (fix),  and  also  separate  instruction was  written  for  MSST-WebUI.  Instead,  you  could  consider  using  WSL  on  Windows  instead  too  (it’s  Ubuntu  with  direct  GPU  access  on  Windows  with  
near
 
zero
 
performance
 
overlay,
 
and
 
even
 
GUI
 
support
 
in
 
newer
 
WSL/Windows
 
version),
 
then
 
follow
 
e.g.
 
the
 
below
 
on
 
WSL:
  -  “I  managed  to  make MSST-WebUI work  [on  Linux]  with:   Torch  2.10.0.dev20251110+rocm7.0   on  RX  7600  (...)  it  seems  like  ROCm  7.0  is  about  a  second  faster  [than  6.x]”   
(probably
 
by
 
adding
 
just
 
pip
 
install
 
before
 
it)
