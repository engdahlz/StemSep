    -  Ensemble  option  -  further  developed  custom  code  of  the  original  MDX23  (not  available  in  
UVR)
 
-
 
custom
 
tech,
 
consisting
 
of
 
various
 
models
 
from
 
UVR
 
and
 
in-house,
 
non-public
 
models
 
unavailable
 
in
 
UVR
  -  Demucs  4  ft  -  (settings  might  be  shifts  1  and  overlap  0.75  as  he  tested  once)  -  same  as  in  
Colabs
 
or
 
UVR
  MDX  B  (not  sure  about  whether  min,  avg,  max  is  set)  -  the  option  has  MDX  arch  models:  -  Newest  MDX  models  added  -  Kimberley  -  Kim  inst  (ft  other),  Kim  Vocal  1  &  2,  HQ_2,  3  -  8.62  2022.01.01  -  is  NET  1  (9.7)  with  Demucs  2,  this  one  has  a  new  name  now.  It  had  slightly  bigger  SDR  in  the  same  multisong dataset  as  the  newer  model  below  -  discrepancy  vs  UVR5  SDR  results  might  be  on  the  server  side  (e.g.  different  chunks),  so  it  might  be  still  
the
 
same.
 
The
 
dates
 
can
 
only
 
relate
 
to
 
date
 
of
 
adding
 
the
 
model
 
to
 
the
 
site
 
and
 
nothing
 
more,
 
not
 
sure
 
here,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
it
 
-
 
NET
 
1
 
is
 
older
 
model
 
than
 
below
 
indeed.
 
Looks
 
like
 
that
 
the
 
model
 
is
 
used
 
with
 
Demucs
 
2
 
enabled
 
(at
 
least
 
he
 
said
 
it
 
was
 
configured
 
like
 
this
 
at
 
some
 
point)
 -  8.51  2022.07.25  -  might  be  vocal  423  a.k.a  main,  not  sure  if  with  Demucs  2  (judging  how  
instrumental
 
from
 
inversion
 
in
 
423
 
looked
 
like
 
-
 
cannot
 
be
 
any
 
inst
 
model
 
yet,
 
since
 
they
 
were
 
released
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2022
 
-
 
epoch
 
418
 
in
 
September
 
to
 
be
 
precise)
 
-
 
it
 
was
 
tested
 
in
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
on
 
page
 
2
 
as
 
MDX
 
B
 
(UVR
 
2022.07.250
 
-
 
the
 
date
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
before,
 
so
 
nothing
 
new
 
here),
 
can't
 
say
 
now
 
if
 
Demucs
 
2
 
is
 
used
 
here.
 
In
 
times
 
of
 
9.7/NET
 
1
 
it
 
was
 
decreasing
 
SDR
 
a
 
bit
 
on
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
which
 
dataset,
 
but
 
instrumentals
 
usually
 
sounded
 
kinda
 
richer
 
with
 
this
 
enabled.
 
Now
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
use
 
other
 
models
 
to
 
ensemble.
 The  change  in  MDX-B  models  scheme  was  probably  to  unify  SDR  metrics  to  multisong  
dataset.
 -  Demucs  3  Model  B  -  mdx_extra  (and  rather  not  mdx_extra_q  as  ZFTurbo  said  it's  "original"  
and
 
used
 
mdx_extra
 
name
 
on
 
the
 
channel
 
referring
 
to
 
this
 
model;
 
in
 
most
 
cases
 
the
 
one
 
below
 
should
 
be
 
better)
  -  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover  HQ  -  the  option  has  VR  architecture  models  Window  size  used  -  512  Here are  all  VR  arch  model  names  -  UVRv5  Demucs  -  rather  the  same  names  -  MVSEp  models  -  unavailable  in  UVR5  -  MDX  B  Karaoke  -  Possibly  MDX-UVR  Karokee  or  MDX-UVR  Karokee  2  
(karokee_4band_v2_sn
 
irc),
 
maybe
 
the
 
latter
  The  rest  below  on  the  MVSEP’s  list  is  outdated  and  not  really  recommended  to  use  anymore    Issues  using  MVSEP   -  NaN  error  during  upload  is  usually  cause  by  unstable  internet  connection,  and  it  usually  
happens
 
on
 
mobile
 
connections
 
when
 
you
 
already
 
upload
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
file
 
elsewhere.
 If  you  have  NaN  error,  just  retry  uploading  your  file.
