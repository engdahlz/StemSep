    their  stuff  on  YT  by  blocking  it  straight  after  uploading  regular  file,  you  may  get  a  copyright  
strike
 
after
 
some
 
time
 
of
 
uploading
 
mastered
 
instrumental
 
as
 
they
 
also
 
use
 
search
 
engine
 
on
 
YT
 
too
 
to
 
find
 
their
 
tracks.
  If  you  don't  find  satisfying  results  with  the  services  below,  read  that.   Paid   https://emastered.com/ (unlimited  free  preview,  150$  per  year)  Preview  is  just  mp3  320kbps  @20kHz  cutoff,  which  is  claimed  to  have  a  watermark,  but  it  
cannot
 
be
 
heard
 
or
 
seen
 
in
 
Spek.
 
The
 
preview
 
file
 
can
 
be
 
downloaded
 
by
 
opening
 
Developer
 
Tools
 
in
 
browser,
 
and
 
playing
 
preview,
 
then
 
in
 
"media",
 
the
 
proper
 
file
 
should
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
list
 
(don't
 
confuse
 
it
 
with
 
original
 
file),
 
now
 
open
 
the
 
proper
 
link
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
tab
 
and
 
open
 
options
 
of
 
the
 
media
 
player
 
and
 
simply
 
click
 
download.
  It's  the  most  advanced  and  better  sounding  service  vs  all  free  ones  I  tested  (even  if  you  have  
only
 
access
 
to
 
mp3,
 
but
 
I
 
also
 
listened
 
to
 
max
 
24
 
bit
 
WAVs
 
on
 
their
 
site
 
with
 
a
 
paid
 
account).
 
Also,
 
it's
 
one
 
of
 
those,
 
which
 
are
 
potentially
 
destructive
 
if
 
you
 
apply
 
wrong
 
settings,
 
but
 
leaving
 
everything
 
in
 
default
 
state
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
starting
 
point,
 
and
 
works
 
decent
 
for
 
e.g.
 
mixtures
 
and
 
even
 
previously
 
mastered
 
music
 
to
 
some
 
extent,
 
at
 
least
 
which
 
does
 
not
 
hit
 
0dB
 
(but
 
e.g.
 
even
 
-1dB,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
claimed
 
to
 
work
 
the
 
best
 
between
 
-3dB
 
and
 
-6dB).
 
Generally
 
I
 
recommend
 
it.
 
Worth
 
trying
 
out.
  Note  for  paid  users  -  be  aware  that  preview  files  can  be  mp3  files  as  well.  So  what  you  hear  
during
 
changing
 
various
 
parameters,
 
is
 
not
 
exactly
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
final
 
WAV
 
output.

brighter

way,
