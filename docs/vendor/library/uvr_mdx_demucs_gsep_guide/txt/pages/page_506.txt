    Version  Advanced  has  a  new  AI  mastering  feature  which  automatically  detects  parameters  
which
 
can
 
be
 
manually
 
adjusted
 
after
 
the
 
process.
 
It
 
works
 
pretty
 
well,
 
and
 
repairs
 
lots
 
of
 
problems
 
with
 
muddy
 
mixes
 
(especially
 
with
 
manual
 
adjustments
 
-
 
don't
 
be
 
afraid
 
to
 
experiment
 
-
 
AI
 
is
 
never
 
perfect).
  Mastering  Assistant  built-in  the  recent  versions  of  Logic  Pro DAW  (MacOS  only)  It  can  give  more  natural  results  than  Izotpe  above    AI  Master  by  Exonic  UK (paid)   master_me (free)  It  contains  a  decent  mastering  chain  which  adjusts  settings  for  you  automatically  for  the  song  
which
 
can
 
be
 
changed
 
later,
 
and
 
also
 
you
 
can
 
change
 
target
 
ilufs
 
value
 
manually.
 
By
 
default,
 
it's
 
-14
 
ilufs
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
too
 
quiet
 
for
 
songs
 
already
 
mastered
 
louder,
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
become
 
destructive
 
while
 
set
 
that
 
way
 
for
 
some
 
songs

Tons  of  options  but  not  comfortable  preview  during  tweaking  them.  You  can  optionally  
specify
 
the
 
reference
 
audio,
 
uploading
 
a
 
file.
 
Also,
 
there’s
 
one
 
completely
 
automatic
 
option.
 
Generally
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
destructive
 
to
 
the
 
sound,
 
even
 
using
 
the
 
most
 
automatic
 
setting
 
-
 
attenuation
 
of
 
bass,
 
exaggerating
 
of
 
higher
 
tones.
  Preferred  options  while  working  with  a  bit  muffled  snare  in  the  mix  of  500m1  model  for

result
 
 (automatic  (easy  master)  is  (only)  good  for  mixtures  [vocal+instr]):   -  True  Peak,  Oversampling  2x,  AM  Level  0.3,  WAV  32.  SAO,  0/22000  (the  rest  
untouched)
 For  still  too  muffled  sound  (e.g.  when  lost  in  lots  of  hi-hats):   -  YouTube  Loudness,  OVS  to  1x  and  AM  Level  0.2  and  24  bit  (+  true  peak,  SAO,  
0/22000)
 Alternative  (good  for  mixtures  and  previously  mastered  music  with  a  bit  muddy  snare):  -  YouTube  Loudness,  Target  Loudness  -8,  Ceiling  -0.2,  OVS  to  2x,  True  Peak  and  AM  
Level
 
0.3
 
and
 
32
 
bit,
 
SAO,
 
0/22000
 The  most  complicated  tool,  but  the  most  capable  amongst  all  free  ones  mentioned  here  so  
far.
 
After
 
two
 
first
 
files,
 
it
 
gets
 
you
 
into
 
a
 
short
 
queue.
 
Processing
 
takes
 
2-3
 
minutes.
 
Cannot
 
upload
 
more
 
tracks
 
than
 
one
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
 
Great
 
metrics,
 
e.g.
 
one
 
measuring
 
overall
 
"professionality"
 
of
 
the
 
result
 
master.
 
At
 
this
 
point,
 
it
 
can
 
also
 
start
