    2nd  one  "limiter.py"  is  a  fork  of  this  Safety  Limiter:  https://github.com/nhthn/safety-limiter/ (54line  to  change  the  audio  inputs)  You  have  "release"  and  "hold_time"  settings.  (no  threshold  here,  you  just  gain  the  input)  ---  Even  if  they  were  sounding  "ok"  with  normal  settings,  the  speed  performances  were  not  
satisfying
 
for
 
any
 
of
 
them
 
for
 
the
 
planned
 
use,
 
I
 
will
 
not
 
develop
 
them
 
more,
 
consider
 
them
 
as
 
abandonware.
 
But
 
they
 
can
 
maybe
 
be
 
usefull
 
for
 
someone
 
else.

You  can  also  read  Aufr33  short  guide   on  his  approach  toward  this  problem  (plus  more  explanations  here)   For  a  problem  of  inconsistent  volume  in  mixture  vs  stems  when  a  limiter  is  used,  sidechain  
mixture
 
to
 
a
 
limiter.
  Other  option,  more  close  to  real  world  processing  :  *  apply  (strong)  compressor/limiter  to  individual  stems  to  mimic  the  mixing  process  *  and  then  apply  (softer/lighter)  compressor/limiter  on  mixture  (with  sidechain  trick)  to  mimic  
the
 
mastering
 
process.
  Because  if  you  apply  too  much  limiting  on  the  mixture,  it  will  destroy  the  sound.  2-stage  
dynamics
 
processing
 
is
 
more
 
transparent.
  The  only  problem  with  the  technique  is  that  there  could  be  clipping  if  we  invert  one  or  more  
stems
 
over
 
the
 
mixture.
 Unless  the  AIs  work  with  [32  bit]  floating  point  (not  integer!)   Exemplary  step-by-step  guide   I  used  side-chain  on  the  2  stems  with  source  3  as  input.  Somehow  I  had  to  set  the  threshold  to  -12db  (instead  of  the  OG  -24db)  i  applied  to  the  
mixture
 
(prolly
 
coz
 
12
 
x
 
2
 
stems)
