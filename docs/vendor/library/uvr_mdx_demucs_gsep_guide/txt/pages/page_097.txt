  -  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #13.1  (beta_0115_MacOS_arm64_hf)  which  applies  a  hotfix  to  address  a  few  graphics  issues.  Be  aware  that  it  doesn’t  incorporate  
demudder
 
from
 
Windows
 
patch
 
#14:
  -  Mac  M1  (arm64)  users  -  Link -  Mac  Intel  (x86_64)  users  -  Link (it  went  offline  for  some  reason;  older  version  below)   Note:  Some  people  get  error  about  failed  malicious  software  check.  Then  check  patch  #9  below  or  read  “MacOS  Users:  Having  Trouble  Opening  UVR?”  section  in  the  repo.  Plus:  “Functionality  for  systems  running  macOS  Catalina  or  lower  is  not  guaranteed”.  Also:  “What  ended  up  working  for  me  was  to  make  sure  that  UVR  lived  in  my  root  level  
Applications
 
folder.
 
I
 
normally
 
have
 
an
 
'Installs'
 
folder
 
inside
 
of
 
Applications
 
to
 
help
 
me
 
keep
 
track
 
of
 
things
 
I
 
have
 
downloaded
 
and
 
installed.
 
Nothing
 
would
 
load
 
from
 
the
 
Installs
 
folder,
 
but
 
worked
 
fine
 
from
 
the
 
root
 
Applications
 
folder.”

UVR_Patch_12_8_24_23_30_BETA:
 Mac  M1  (arm64)  users  -  Link Mac  Intel  (x86_64)  users  -  Link (Patch  #9  fixes  mainly  Apollo  arch  issues)   
 Apollo  arch  was  made  compatible  with  MacOS  MPS  (metal)  but  it  might  be  unstable  and  
very
 
RAM
 
intensive
 
-
 
use
 
chunk
 
size
 
over
 
7
 
to
 
prevent
 
errors.
 
Apollo
 
is
 
now
 
compatible
 
with
 
all
 
Lew
 
models
 
(fixed
 
incompatibility
 
with
 
any
 
other
 
than
 
previously
 
available
 
in

Center).
 
Fixed
 
Matchering
 
(presumably
 
regression).
