    -  Moises.AI  (the  rumour  says  it’s  better  than  Bandit  v2,  but  it’s  expensive  “Dialogue,  
Soundtrack,
 
Effects”)
 -  Older  DNR  model  on  MVSEP  from  ‘22   I  think  the  most  commonly  used  recent  SFX  models  discussed  in  the  server  before  DnR  v3  
ones
 
are
 
DNR
 
Demucs
 
4
 
model
 
and
 
Bandit
 
v2,
 
but
 
I
 
haven't
 
seen
 
any
 
settlement
 
in
 
the
 
community
 
on
 
which
 
model
 
is
 
the
 
best,
 
hence
 
it
 
might
 
simply
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song.
  -  voc_ft  -  sometimes  it  can  be  better  than  Demucs  DNR  model  (although  still  not  perfect)  -  jazzpear94  model (VR-arch)  -  put  the  .pth  file  to:  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\VR_Models.  On  UVR  start  set  config:  1band  sr44100  hl  1024,  stem  name:  SFX,  Do  NOT  check  inverse  stem  in  UVR5,  5.1  disabled.  Or  put  that  file to  model_data  subfolder.  -  (dl)  source by  Forte  (VR)   (probably  setting  to:  instrumental/1band_44100_hl1024  is  the  proper  config)  Might  work  in  Colab  “I  tried  it  with  the  SFX  models,  and  I  just  uploaded  them  
in
 
the
 
models
 
folder
 
and
 
then
 
placed
 
the
 
model
 
name,
 
and
 
it
 
processed
 
them”
 
and
 
may
 
even
 
work
 
in
 
UVR.

 RipX  is  “not  as  good  as  UVR5  for  actual  separation,  but  RipX  is  very  good  if  you  need  to  edit
