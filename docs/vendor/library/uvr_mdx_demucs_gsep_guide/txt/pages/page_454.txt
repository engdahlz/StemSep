    The  snare  in  1)  has  the  best  SDR  out  of  all  available  models.  
Kick
 
and
 
toms
 
are
 
still
 
the
 
best
 
SDR-wise
 
in

ensemble
 
(new
 
ensemble
 
with
 
these
 
new
 
Mel-Roformers
 
so
 
far)
  -  The  new  models  “are  very  great  for  ride/crash/hh.  And  overall,  they  have  the  best  metrics  
for
 
almost
 
all
 
stems.”

  Sometimes  the  newer  jarredou’s  drumsep  6  stems  model  below  can  serve  to  clean  up

 “The  core  problem  is  that  the  main  MVSep  Drums  model  which  is  used  by  everything-  
including
 
the
 
Drumsep
 
models-
 
is
 
not
 
purely
 
drums,
 
it's

(newer)  MDX23C  5  stem  drumsep  by  jarredou   Download.  All  SDR  metrics  are  better  than  the  previous  6  stem  model  below:  SDR:  kick:  16.66,  snare:  11.54,  toms  12.34,  hihat:  4.04,  cymbals:  6.36  (all  metrics).  Metric  fullness  for  snare:  25.0361,  bleedless  for  hh:  12.3470,  log_wmse  for  snare:  13.8959  “it's  more  on  the  fullness  side  than  bleedless”  -  from  all  the  metrics,  only  bleedless  for  snare  
is
 
worse
 
than
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
model:
 
 26.8420  vs  30.4149  “Quite  cleaner  than  the  previous  [6  stem]  one”,  “a  lot  noisier  than  other  drumpsep  models,  
but
 
that's
 
not
 
necessarily
 
a
 
bad
 
thing.”
 Possible  “UnpicklingError:  "invalid  load  key,  '\x0a'."”  issue  in  UVR  if  you  use  the  old  6  stem  
yaml.
