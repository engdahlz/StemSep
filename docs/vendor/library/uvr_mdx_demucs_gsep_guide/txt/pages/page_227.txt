  Don't  forget  reading  vocals to  find  the  best  separation  method  for  your  song  to  use  it  for  separation  with  Karaoke/BVE  models.   Recommended  ensemble  settings  for  Karaoke  in  UVR  5  GUI  (instrumentals  with  backing  
vocals):
 -  5_HP-Karaoke-UVR,  6_HP-Karaoke-UVR,  UVR-MDX-NET  Karaoke  2  (Max  Spec)  (in  e.g.  “min/max”  the  latter  is  for  instrumental)   -  Alternatively,  use  Manual  Ensemble  with  UVR  with  Max  Spec  using  x-minus’  UVR  BVE  v2  result  and  the  UVR  ensemble  result  from  the  above.   Or  single  model:  -  HP_KAROKEE-MSB2-3BAND-3090  (a.k.a.  VR's  6HP-Karaoke-UVR)  -  UVR  BV  v2  on  x-minus  (and  download  "Song  without  L.V.".  Better  solution,  newer,  different  
model)
 -  5HP  can  be  sometimes  better  than  6HP  (UVR5  GUI /  x-minus.pro /  Colab)  -  you  might  want  to  use  Kim  Vocal  2  or  voc_ft  or  1296  or  MDX23C  first  for  better  results.  -  UVR-BVE-4B_SN-44100-1   Q:  What  are  the  differences  between  Mel-Roformer  Karaoke  and  the  last  model?  A:  If  the  vocals  don't  contain  harmonies,  this  model  (Mel)  is  better.  In  other  cases,  it  is  better  
to
