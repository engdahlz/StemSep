[page 452/642]
    the  paper  for  the  Bs/Mel  archs,  and  it  was  implemented  and  coded  by  Lucidrains,  so  later  
could
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
training.
  Later,  they  seemingly  spread  information  among  users  privately,  that  despite  the  similarities  
in
 
SDR,
 
the
 
18.75
 
score
 
is
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
a
 
trolling,
 
someone
 
other
 
than
 
ByteDance.
 
Some
 
people
 
favoring
 
ByteDance
 
were
 
rumored
 
for
 
disruptive,
 
trolling
 
behavior
 
on
 
our
 
server
 
too,
 
harassing
 
other
 
users,
 
or
 
just
 
being
 
unkind
 
to
 
others
 
etc.
 
Besides,
 
the
 
same
 
person
 
responsible,
 
was
 
also
 
the
 
most
 
informed
 
about
 
ByteDance
 
next
 
moves,
 
and
 
was
 
also
 
changing
 
nicknames
 
or
 
accounts
 
frequently.
 
Also
 
possessed
 
great
 
ML
 
knowledge.
 
Many
 
coincidences.
 
In
 
the
 
end,
 
the
 
same
 
user,
 
zmis
 
(if
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
details
 
of
 
the
 
account
 
above),
 
was
 
behind
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
newly
 
created,
 
accounts,
 
which
 
were
 
banned
 
on
 
our
 
server.
 
 The  same  day  or  in  very  similar  period,  a  new  account  was  created,  conducting  the  same  
behavior,
 
when
 
previous
 
was
 
banned.
 The  main  core  of  their  activities,  was  spreading  misinformation  about  SDR  metrics,  telling  
that
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
thing
 
in
 
the
 
world,
 
because
 
their
 
own
 
arch
 
is
 
good
 
at
 
it,
 
hence
 
the
 
narration.
 So  don't  bother,  and  do  your  good  job  not  feeding  troll  from  other  company.  They  don't  like  
competition,
 
doing
 
their
 
own
 
moves
 
behind
 
backdrops
 
and
 
become
 
better.
  It’s  not  impossible  to  fake  SDR  results  in  the  MVSEP  leaderboard.  For  current  public  archs,  
you’d
 
need
 
to
 
feed
 
your
 
dataset
 
both
 
by
 
the
 
songs
 
in
 
the
 
evaluation
 
dataset,
 
keeping
 
your
 
regular
 
big
 
dataset
 
in
 
place,
 
so
 
you
 
simply
 
lose
 
evaluation
 
factor
 
of
 
this
 
leaderboard,
 
or
 
you
 
can
 
simply
 
mix
 
your
 
result
 
stems
 
with
 
original
 
stems.
 
“SDR
 
focuses
 
more
 
on
 
lower
 
frequencies,
 
it
 
can
 
easily
 
be
 
fooled
 
into
 
giving
 
a
 
higher
 
score
 
if
 
the
 
lower
 
frequencies
 
are
 
louder,
 
Bas
 
tested
 
this
 
theory
 
and
 
confirmed
 
it”.
 
you
 
can
 
boost
 
the
 
bass,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
score
 
+1
 
or
 
+2
 
sdr
 
higher
 
or
 
something,
 
that's
 
why
 
It's
 
not
 
always
 
reliable”

Those
 
results,
 
which
 
are
 
not
 
faked,
 
are
 
at
 
least
 
those,
 
which
 
were
 
uploaded
 
by
 
various
 
users
 
evaluating
 
the
 
same
 
public,
 
available
 
for
 
offline
 
use
 
models,
 
but
 
usually
 
uploaded
 
with
 
various
 
parameters
 
which
 
affects
 
SDR
 
(so
 
usually
 
the
 
better
 
parameters,
 
the
 
higher
 
SDR,
 
but
 
not
 
always),
 
remain
 
consistent
 
among
 
various
 
users
 
evaluations
 
with
 
similar
 
parameters
 
and
 
inference
 
code,
 
so
 
scalability
 
is
 
correct
 
and
 
preserved,
 
thus
 
the
 
results
 
weren’t
 
faked,
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
reproduced
 
with
 
similar
 
SDR.
 
For
 
the
 
other
 
scores
 
from
 
unpublic
 
inferences/models/methods,
 
we
 
simply
 
trust
 
ZFTurbo
 
and
 
rather
 
viperx
 
too,
 
as
 
they’re/were
 
our
 
trusted
 
users
 
for
 
years.
 
Also,
 
the
 
leaderboard
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
tends
 
to
 
give
 
better
 
SDR
 
to
 
the
 
results
 
with
 
more
 
residues
 
on
 
different
 
occasions
 
before,
 
so
 
the
 
chart
 
is
 
simply
 
not
 
fully
 
reliable
 
for
 
that,
 
but
 
rather
 
not
 
manipulated
 
in
 
its
 
core
 
either.
 
It’s
 
more
 
a
 
nature
 
of
 
SDR
 
measurement
 
and/or
 
used
 
dataset.
 
  ViperX  trained  the  first  community  BS-Roformer  model  similar  to  SAMI  v1.0  model,  although  
2
 
stems
 
(and
 
lower
 
scoring
 
Mel
 
at
 
the
 
time).
 
His
 
BS
 
model
 
sounds
 
similar
 
to
 
Ripple
 
(although
 
it's
 
only
 
2
 
stem,
 
while
 
4
 
stem
 
Ripple
 
variant
 
scores
 
a
 
bit
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
2
 
stem
 
variant,
 
but
 
still
 
lower
 
than
 
ViperX
 
and
 
v1.0).
 
Then
 
there
 
were
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
community
 
trained
