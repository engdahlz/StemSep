  0b)  Max  Spec  manual  ensemble  of:  v1e+  +  MVSEP  BS-Roformer  2025.07  model   -  It’s  a  Senn’s  method  below,  simplified  (IntroC)  “I  think  (...)  [it]  would  be  good  enough.  The  way  v1e+  keeps  the  noise  is  usually  fine,  and  the

model
 
should
 
bring
 
back
 
the
 
lost
 
masked
 
frequencies
 
for
 
v1e+.
 
Otherwise,
 
just
 
adjust
 
the
 
weight
 
of
 
v1e+
 
for

reduce
 
the
 
noise”
  0b)  Max  Spec  manual  ensemble  of:  v1e+  +  MVSEP  BS-Roformer  2025.07  model  +  Becruily  
inst
 -  Senn’s  method  simplified  (IntroC/Sakku)  “sometimes  becruily  can  catch  a  tiny  instr  while  v1e+  can't”  -  Sakku   *)  Senn’s  OG  method:  Use  the  highest  SDR  BS  Roformer  model  on  MVSEP  and  the  best  Fullness  Melband  
Ro-Former
 
model
 
(unwa
 
instrumental
 
v1e
 
plus)
 
-
 
mixed
 
both
 
with
 
one
 
of
 
them
 
phase-inverted,
 
then
 
use
 
Soothe2
 
to
 
filter
 
out
 
resonants,
 
leaving
 
mostly
 
only
 
noise,
 
further
 
filter
 
and
 
mix
 
them,
 
use
 
a
 
few
 
plugins
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
spectral
 
flattening,
 
very
 
minor.
 In  other  words:  “Pass  the  music  through  BS  RoFormer's  best  SDR  and  the  best  Fullness,  which  is  Unwa  
Instrumental
 
v1e
 
plus
 in  iZotope  RX,  Invert  the  phase  of  any  of  the  tracks,  and  copy  n  paste  to  the  other  track,  the  
result
 
should
 
be
 
some
 
ghastly
 
sounding
 
reverb
 
of
 
the
 
vocals
 using  iZotope  RX's  Deconstruct,  you  wanna  filter  out  the  tonal  signal  of  the  voice  as  to  
remove
 
the
 
more
 
obvious
 
"sinusoidal"
 
signals.
 
It
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
fairly
 
subtle
 
as
 
to
 
not
 
damage
 
the
 
noisy
 
residuals
 Now  with  Soothe2,  you  wanna  filter  out  any  of  the  more  aggressive  noisy  components,  I  use  
this
 
setting,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
not
 
work
 
100%
 
for
 
everyone

(You
 
can
 
replace
 
this
 
with
 
any
 
plugin
 
that
 
acts
 
similar
 
to
 
Soothe2,
 
but
 
Soothe2
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
compromise)
 If  needed,  you  can  use  Deconstruct  as  well  but  reducing  the  noisy  aspects  just  to  wipe  out  
that
 
aggressive
 
noisy
 
artifact
 Mess  with  the  gain,  and  then  add  it  back  to  the  BS  RoFormer  track  (don't  forget  to  invert  the  
phase
 
again),
 
Ideally
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
fairly
 
subtle
 For  post-processing:  I  use  MSpectralDynamics  to  add  a  slight  spectral  flattening  to  the  track,  and  Unchirp  to  
denoise
 
very
 
slightly
 
the
 
higher
 
frequencies
 
to
 
remove
 
that
 
digital
 
hissy
 
artifact
 
and
 
also
 
tighten
 
more
 
of
 
the
 
sound
 A  very  subtle  Gullfoss  can  also  brighten  the  track  slightly  as  well  to  compensate  here  is  the  result”  (thx  senn)
