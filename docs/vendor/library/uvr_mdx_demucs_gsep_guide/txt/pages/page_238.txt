    -  Ensemble  2/4/8  stems  (MVSEP,  paid)  -  similar  or  better  results  with  newer  single  stem  models  combined,  various  ensembles  to  choose  from,  freedom  to  experiment.  Read all  the  ensembles  metrics  sorted  by  instrumental  bleedless.    Chained  separation  order   With  single  stem  models  below,  feel  free  to  experiment  with  different  orders  of  sequential  
stem
 
separation:
 #1  1)  Instrumental  model  first  2)  then  drums  or  bass  3)  piano  or  guitar  4)  strings  or  horns   
If
 
your
 
song
 
has
 
“weird
 
percussion
 
that
 
don't
 
get
 
picked
 
up
 
by
 
drum
 
models
 
and
 
if
 
it's
 
piano-heavy,
 
I
 
would
 
go
 
for
 
piano
 
first,
 
but
 
it
 
sometimes
 
leaves
 
piano
 
behind”

 #3  ZFTurbo:  “After  each  remove,  you  also  remove  some  useful  parts  for  next  instruments.  So  
I'd
 
propose
 
to
 
first
 
use
 
the
 
models
 
with
 
the
 
best
 
quality.

in

 #4   (dynamic64)  “I  think  this  is  my  new  default  [order]:   Bass  Ensemble  (SCNet  XL  +  BS  Roformer  +  HTDemucs4),  Drums  MVSep  SCNet  XL,  Piano

 Example:  “Personally,  I  like  putting  the  instrumental  through  mvsep  bass  model  (above),  
then
 
putting
 
the
 
other
 
stem
 
through
 
mvsep
 
drums
 
(specifically
 
SCNet
 
XL),
 
then
 
putting
 
the
 
other
 
stem
 
of
 
that
 
through
 
the
 
6
 
stem
 
model
 
[a.k.a.
 
SW]
 The  6  stem  model  is  best  for  piano  and  guitar,  and  separating  out  the  drums  and  bass  
beforehand
 
helps
 
that
 
model
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
work
 
as
 
hard.
 And  it  also  allows  you  to  manually  add  anything  that  the  first  2  models  missed,  because  its  a  
6
 
stem
 
model,
 
and
 
re-separates
 
any
 
missed
 
drum
 
and
 
bass.
 Creates  close  to  studio  results.  As  close  to  studio  as  I've  ever  heard”  #5  In  case  of  ensembling  various  models  of  the  same  stem,  if  the  top  model  in  terms  of  SDR  
doesn’t
 
have
 
significantly
 
lower
 
metric,
 
sometimes
 
it’s
 
better
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
instead
 
of
 
ensemble
 
[esp.
 
if
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
have
 
any
 
crossbleeding]
 
(thx
 
dynamic64).
 Just  be  aware  that  it  might  vary  from  song  to  song  #6*
