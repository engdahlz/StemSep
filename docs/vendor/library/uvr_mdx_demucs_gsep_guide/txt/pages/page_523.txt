    It  was  introduced  to  Colab  at  some  point.  Once  I  tried  to  log  into  another  account  
during
 
mounting,
 
it
 
displayed
 
a
 
new
 
window
 
with
 
only
 
one
 
account,
 
where
 
the
 
wanted
 
account
 
didn't
 
appear,
 
and
 
when
 
I
 
manually
 
signed
 
in
 
to
 
it,
 
Colab
 
showed
 
an
 
error
 
on
 
Colab,
 
something
 
about
 
unsuccessful
 
authorisation.
 
When
 
I
 
changed
 
account
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
corner
 
this
 
time
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
account
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
choose
 
when
 
mounting,
 
everything
 
went
 
fine
 
as
 
it
 
always
 
used
 
to
 
be.
 
Full
 
list
 
of
 
accounts
 
appeared.
 
HV
 
Colabs
 
already
 
have
 
the
 
new
 
mount
 
method
 
implemented,
 
so
 
the
 
old
 
one
 
doesn’t
 
cause
 
error,
 
but
 
in
 
UVR
 
notebook
 
you
 
can
 
choose
 
between
 
the
 
new
 
(default)
 
and
 
the
 
old
 
one
 
(just
 
in
 
case
 
Google
 
changed
 
something
 
again).
  -  Try  to  log  into  another  Google  account(s)  if  you  cannot  connect  with  GPU  anymore  
and/or
 
you
 
exceeded
 
your
 
GPU
 
limit
  -  (cannot  really  say  if  it’s  really  helpful  at  this  point)   Paste  this  code  to  console  (Chrome:  CTRL+Shift+I  or  …>more  tools>tools  for  
developers>console)
 
to
 
avoid
 
disconnections
 
from
 
runtime
 
environment
 
or
 
if
 
you
 
encounter
 
problems
 
while
 
being
 
AFK
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
into
 
issues
 
of
 
being
 
unable
 
to
 
connect
 
to
 
GPU
 
after
 
reconnection
 
after
 
idle
 
time
 
or
 
possibly
 
after
 
the
 
code
 
was
 
executed,
 
and
 
you’re
 
AFK
 
for
 
too
 
long.
 
It
 
won’t
 
prevent
 
you
 
from
 
showing
 
one
 
captcha
 
in
 
the
 
session.
  interval  =  setInterval(function()  {       console.log("working")      var  selector  =  "#top-toolbar  >  colab-connect-button"      document.querySelector(selector).shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click()      setTimeout(function()  {              document.querySelector(selector).shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click()      },  1000)  },  60*1000)   It  will  constantly  reclick  one  window  to  appear  in  Colab  to  prevent  idle  check.
