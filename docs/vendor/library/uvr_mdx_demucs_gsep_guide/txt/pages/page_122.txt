[page 122/642]
    -  (probably  fixed)  For  all  jarredou's  MDX23  v.  2.3  Colab  fork  users:   “Components  of  VitLarge  arch  are  hosted  on  Huggingface...  when  their  maintenance  will  be  
finished
 
it
 
will
 
work
 
again.
 
I
 
can't
 
do
 
anything
 
about
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
meantime.”
  2.2  and  2.1  and  MVSEP.com  4-8  models  ensemble  (premium  users)  should  work  fine.   -  Ripple  now  has  fade  in  and  clicking  issues  fixed.  Also,  there's  less  bleeding  in  the  other  
stem
 
(but
 
Bas
 
Curtiz’
 
trick
 
for
 
-3dB/-4dB
 
input
 
volume
 
decreasing
 
can
 
be
 
still
 
necessary).
 “Ripple’s  lossless  outputs  are  weird,  some  stems  like  the  drums  are  semi  full  band  (kicks  go  
full
 
band,
 
snares
 
not
 
etc)
 
and
 
the
 
“other”
 
stem
 
looks
 
like
 
fake
 
full
 
band”.
 
These
 
fixes
 
are
 
applied
 
also
 
for
 
old
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
app.
 Also,  the  lossless  option  fixes  to  some  extend  the  offset  issue  so  it's  more  similar  to  input  
now,
 
but
 
not
 
identical
 
(lossless
 
option
 
might
 
require
 
updating).
 
Also
 
no
 
more
 
abrupt
 
endings
 
  Ripple   =  better  than  CapCut  as  of  now  (and  fullband).  plus  Ripple  fixed  the  click/artifacts  using  cross-fade  technique  between  the  chunks.   -  ViperX  currently  doesn't  plan  to  release  his  BS-Roformer  model   -  New  “uvr  de-crowd  (beta)”  model  added  on  x-minus.  Seems  to  provide  better  results  than  
the
 
MVSEP
 
model.
 
Also,
 
an
 
MDX
 
arch
 
model
 
version
 
is
 
planned
 
for
 
training.
  “At  minimum  aggressiveness  value,  a  second  model  is  now  used,  which  removes  less  crowd  
but
 
preserves
 
other
 
sounds/instruments
 
better.”
  -  Ripple  seems  to  have  a  lossless  export  option  now.  “First  make  sure  the  app  is  updated  
then
 
click
 
the
 
folder
 
then
 
click
 
the
 
magnet
 
icon
 
then
 
export
 
and
 
change
 
it
 
to
 
lossless”
  -  Seems  like  CapCut  now  has  added  separation  inside  Android  Capcut  app  in  unlocked  Pro  
version
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas (made  by  ByteDance)  Seems  like  there  is  no  other  Pro  variant  for  this  app.  At  least  unlocked  version  on  apklite.me  have  a  link  to  regular  version,  so  it  doesn't  seem  to  
be
 
Pro
 
app
 
behind
 
any
 
regional
 
block.
 
But
 
-
 "Indian  users  -  Use  VPN  for  Pro"  as  they  say,  so  similar  situation  like  we  had  on  PC  Capcut before.  Can't  guarantee  that  unlocked  version  on  apklite.me  is  clean.  I've  never  downloaded  
anything
 
from
 
there.
  -  Mega,  GDrive  and  direct  link  support  for  input  files  added  on  MVSep.  If  you  want  to  apply  
MVSep
 
algorithm
 
to
 
result
 
of
 
other
 
algorithm,
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
"Direct
 
link"
 
upload
 
and
 
point
 
https
 
link
 
on
 
separated
 
audio-file
 
on
 
MVSep.
