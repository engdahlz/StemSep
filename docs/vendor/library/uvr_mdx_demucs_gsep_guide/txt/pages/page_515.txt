    So  if  you  want  to  batch  upload  on  YouTube  the  name  will  not  appear  as  "song  artist  
song
 
title"
 
but
 
"Song
 
Artist
 
Song
 
Title"
 
(since
 
YT
 
removes
 
dashes
 
and
 
commas
 
etc.)
 9)  It  seems  like  720p  is  now  enough  to  get  Opus  after  upload  (thx  dca100fb8  -  9.  &  8.)    
___Best  quality  from  YouTube  and  Soundcloud  -  how  to  squeeze  out  the  most  
from
 
the
 
music
 
taken
 
from
 
YT
 
for
 
separation___
  Sometimes  a  better  source  just  doesn’t  exist,  and  only  YouTube  audio  can  be  used  
for
 
separation
 
in
 
some
 
cases.
 
  Introduction  Audio  on  YT  in  most  cases  is  available  in  two  formats:   1)  AAC  (m4a)  and  Opus.  As  I  mentioned,  the  latter  appears  for  older  or  popular  
uploads,
 
or
 
videos
 
uploaded
 
in
 
QHD
 
or
 
4K.
 
Most
 
videos
 
will
 
have
 
both
 
formats
 
available
 
already.
 
Currently
 
only
 
browsers
 
without
 
Opus
 
support
 
plau
 
that
 
audio
 
stream
 
(iirc
 
Safari)
 AAC  on  YT  is  @128kbps  with  16kHz  cutoff  and  44kHz  (that’s  not  artificial  cutoff  -  
that’s
 
how
 
the
 
codec
 
normally
 
behaves
 
when
 
such
 
bitrate
 
is
 
set).
 2)  Opus  on  YT  is  96/128/152kbps  with  20kHz  cutoff  (spectrum  up  to  24kHz  for  videos  
uploaded
 
before
 
~2020+,
 
but
 
only
 
with
 
some
 
aliasing
 
above
 
20kHz,
 
probably
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
applied
 
resampler)
 
always
 
48kHz
 
(44kHz
 
audio
 
is
 
always
 
upsampled
 
with
 
built-in
 
resampler
 
in
 
Opus
 
-
 
that’s
 
how
 
the
 
Opus
 
works
 
-
 
it
 
has
 
always
 
48Khz
 
output).
  1)  and  2)  can  be  downloaded,  e.g.  via  JDownloader  2  (once  you  downloaded  one  
file,
 
you
 
must
 
delete
 
the
 
previously
 
shown
 
entry
 
in
 
link
 
grabber
 
and
 
add
 
the
 
link
 
once
 
more,
 
and
 
now
 
pick
 
the
 
Opus
 
(m4a
 
is
 
default)
 
for
 
download).
 You  can  also  use  online  too  https://cobalt.tools/ which  is  probably  just  GUI  for  yt-dlp.   Opus  files  downloaded  from  JDownloader  are  different  than  Opus  in  webm  files  
seeing
 
by
 
spectrum,
 
but
 
I
 
can’t
 
compare
 
it
 
with
 
Cobalt
 
as
 
Spek
 
doesn’t
 
cooperate
 
with
 
its
 
webm
 
files
 
in
 
at
 
least
 
progressive
 
mode
 
which
 
is
 
“direct
 
vimeo
 
stream”.
 
yt-dlp
 
with
 
-x
 
argument
 
might
 
be
 
free
 
of
 
the
 
issue,
 
but
 
I
 
haven’t
 
checked
 
yet.
  Don't  download  as  Opus  from  JDownloader  2.  The  quality  will  be  affected.   Download  always  as  webm  in  any  quality  -  all  qualities  will  contain  the  same  Opus  
audio
 
stream
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
bitrate.
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
sometimes
 
JDownloader
 
wrongly
 
reports
 
bitrate
 
as
 
96kbps,
 
while
 
when
 
you
 
demux
 
the
 
webm
 
file
 
with
 
MKVToolnix-GUI
 
and
 
then
 
with
 
MKVExtractGUI2
 
(compatible
 
with
 
MKVToolnix
 
v
 
20),
 
the
 
result
 
Opus
 
file
 
(add
 
extension
 
manually
 
afterwards)
 
will
 
have
 
average
 
bitrate
 
of
 
not
 
much
 
below
 
128kbps
 
(that’s
 
how
 
VBR
 
works).
