     “0  –  You  need  Python:  https://www.python.org/downloads/  0a  –  I  would  also  recommend  installing  Pytorch  too  from  here:  https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ (grab  the  command  and  enter  it  into  the  command  prompt)   0b  –  But  then  you  can  just  also  double-click  on  guiwx.py  on  the  repo,  and  it  is  much  easier.    That's  the  harder  method  with  the  command  prompt   1  –  Go  there:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training and  clone  the  repository  (click  on  Code  =>  Download  as  zip)   2  –  Go  to  the  repo  folder,  create  3  new  folders:  results,  input  and  separation_results.   
Place
 
your
 
tracks
 
in
 
the
 
input
 
folder.
 
Place
 
the
 
checkpoint
 
in
 
results
 
and
 
leave
 
the
 
yaml
 
at
 
the
 
root
 
of
 
the
 
repo
 
(where
 
inference.py
 
and
 
requirements.txt
 
are)
  3  –  Open  command  prompt,  type  in  cd  
C://Users/[YOURUSERNAME]/Desktop/Music-Source-Separation-Training-main
 
 
(changes
 
directory
 
to
 
the
 
repo
 
folder
 
on
 
your
 
desktop)
  4  –  Type  in:  python  install  -r  requirements.txt   5  –  Let  it  install  the  requirements   6  –  Type  in:  python  inference.py  --model_type  mel_band_roformer  --config_path  [NAME  OF  
YAML]
 
--start_check_point
 
results/[NAME
 
OF
 
CHECKPOINT]
 
--input_folder
 
input/
 
--store_dir
 
separation_results/
 
--extract_instrumental
