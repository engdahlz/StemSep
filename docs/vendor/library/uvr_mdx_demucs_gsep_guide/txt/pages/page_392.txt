    This  is  also  a  model  that  focuses  on  lower  end  frequencies,  but  trained  with  different  
parameters.
 MGM_LOWEND_C_v4_sr16000_hl512_nf2048.pth  -   This  is  also  a  model  that  focuses  on  lower  end  frequencies,  but  trained  on  a  very  low  sample  
rate.
 MGM_HIGHEND_v4_sr44100_hl1024_nf2048.pth  -   This  model  slightly  focuses  a  bit  more  on  higher  end  frequencies.  MODEL_BVKARAOKE_by_aufr33_v4_sr33075_hl384_nf1536.pth  -   This  is  a  beta  model  that  removes  main  vocals  while  leaving  background  vocals  intact.   Stacked  Models   StackedMGM_MM_v4_sr44100_hl512_nf2048.pth  -   This  is  a  strong  vocal  artifact  removal  model.  This  model  was  made  to  run  with

VR  ensemble  settings   As  for  VR  architecture,  ensemble  is  the  most  universal  and  versatile  solution  for  lots  of  
tracks.
 
It
 
delivers,
 
when
 
results
 
achieved
 
with
 
single
 
models
 
fail
 
-
 
e.g.
 
when
 
snare
 
is
 
too
 
muffled
 
or
 
distorted
 
along
 
with
 
some
 
instruments,
 
but
 
sometimes
 
a
 
single
 
model
 
can
 
still
 
provide
 
more
 
clarity,
 
so
 
it’s
 
not
 
universal
 
for
 
every
 
track.
 
 In  most  cases,  ensemble  of  only  VR  models  is  dedicated  for  the  tracks  when  in  the  most  
prevailing
 
moments
 
of
 
busy
 
mix
 
in
 
the
 
track,
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
major
 
bleeding
 
using
 
single
 
VR
 
model(s)
 
because
 
it
 
rarely
 
removes
 
that
 
well
 
vocal
 
residues
 
from
 
instrumentals
 
better
 
than
 
current
 
MDX
 
models,
 
or
 
with
 
high
 
aggressiveness
 
it
 
becomes
 
too
 
destructive.
  Order  of  models  is  crucial  (at  least  in  the  Colab)!  Set  the  model  with  the  best  results  as  the  
first
 
one.
 
Usually,
 
using
 
more
 
than
 
4
 
models
 
has
 
a
 
negative
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
quality.
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
you
 
cannot
 
use
 
postprocess
 
in
 
HV
 
Colab
 
in
 
this
 
mode,
 
otherwise
 
you’ll
 
encounter
 
an
 
error.
