 Generally,  MQA  is  the  least  of  lossy  codecs  -  you  might  consider  picking  it  where  its  24  bit  
variant
 
is

(separate
 
the

the

should
 
notice
 
any
 
differences
 
easier

  Comparisons  of  various  versions  of  the  FLAC  files  on  streaming  services   Use  Audio  MD5  in  Foobar  >properties  of  the  file  (or  download  AudioMD5Checker)  to  not  run  in  circles  looking  for  various  versions  of  the  same  track  with  the  same  length.  Some  FLAC  
files
 
don’t
 
have
 
MD5
 
checksums
 
in
 
F2K
 
shown,
 
so
 
you’ll
 
need
 
to
 
download
 
AudioMD5Checker.
  E.g.  on  Tidal  Recovery  by  Eminem  returns  the  same  MD5  for  Deluxe  and  regular  album,  but  using  https://free-mp3-download.net (Deezer),  checksums  are  different  for  both  (to  differentiate  -  albums  on  the  net  site  have  various  release  dates),  but  Deluxe  on  Tidal  with  
regular
 
on
 
(Deezer)
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
MD5.
 
And
 
when
 
Audio
 
MD5
 
checksums
 
were
 
different,
 
there
 
were
 
different
 
results
 
after
 
separation.
 
In
 
this
 
case
 
of
 
one
 
unique
 
vs
 
3
 
same
 
MD5,
 
the
 
unique
 
resulted
 
in
 
worse
 
separation
 
(but
 
it
 
can
 
depend
 
on
 
more
 
factors
 
in
 
other
 
cases).
 
Be
 
aware
 
of
 
non-explicit
 
versions
 
which
 
will
 
naturally
 
have
 
different
 
checksum.
