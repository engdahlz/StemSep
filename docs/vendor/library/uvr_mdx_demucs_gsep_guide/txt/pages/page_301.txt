    On  some  raw  instrument  recordings,  I  have  seen  20%~30%  DC  offset  sometimes,  which  can  
become
 
a
 
real
 
issue
 
for
 
mixing
 
then,
 
as
 
it's
 
reducing
 
headroom”

  40.  Ensemble  of  pitch  shifted  results  (point  4  continues)   So  you  follow  the  point  4,  and  “change  sample  rate  before  each  separation  and  restore  it  
after
 
for
 
each,
 
then
 
ensemble
 
them
 
all”.
  “on  drums  it  was  really  working  great,  where  sometimes  you  have  sudden  muffled  snare  
because
 
other
 
[stem]
 
masked
 
it,
 
the
 
SRS
 
ensemble
 
[irc
 
used
 
in
 
MDX23
 
2.x
 
Colab
 
and
 
KaraFan]
 
was
 
helping
 
a
 
lot
 
with
 
that,
 
making
 
separation
 
more
 
coherent
 
across
 
the
 
track.”
  41.  A5  method  for  clean  separations   Consider  the  fake  stereo  trick  fist  from  point  11,  separate  with  BS-Roformer  1296,  clean  the  
residues
 
in
 
vocals
 
manually,
 
put
 
the
 
vocals
 
back
 
into
 
mixture
 
-
 
so
 
perform
 
mixdown
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
mixture
 
again,
 
and
 
then
 
separate
 
this
 
mixture
 
with
 
demucs_ft
 
(old
 
models)
  42.  Using  surround  versions  of  songs   Sometimes  you  can  get  vocals  separated  easier  from  center  channel  from  surround  version  
of
 
the
 
song.
 
Perhaps
 
you
 
might
 
also
 
get
 
different
 
separations
 
of
 
instrumentals
 
from
 
such
 
versions,
 
also
 
with
 
possibility
 
of
 
manipulating
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
specific
 
tracks
 
before
 
mixdown
 
to
 
2.0/stereo
 
file.
 
It
 
might
 
be
 
necessary
 
anyway,
 
because
 
otherwise
 
you
 
might
 
run
 
into
 
some
 
errors
 
on
 
an
 
attempt
 
of
 
separation
 
of
 
5.1
 
file
 
or
 
with
 
more
 
channels.
 Use  Dolby  Atmos/360  Reality  Audio/5.1  version  of  the  song   Multichannel  mixes  can  give  better  results  for  separation.  For  more  on  Atmos  read.   Be  aware  that  center  may  contain  not  only  vocal,  but  also  some  effects.   Consider  separating  every  channel  separately,  or  one  pair  of  channels  at  the  time  (rear,  
front,
 
center,
 
sides
 
separately)
 
or
 
only
 
separate
 
center
 
channel
 
separately
 
and
 
all
 
the
 
rest
 
separately.

instrumental
 
much
 
better
 
than
 
some
 
cleaner,
 
but
 
muddy
 
result,
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
that
 
noisy
 
result
 as  the  reference  for  more  muddy  target  file.  E.g.  voc_ft  used  as  reference  for  GSEP  2  stem  
instrumental
 
output.
  44.  Retry  separation  2–3  times
