[page 494/642]
    Looks  like,  unlike  24/48  files,  all  24/96/192kHz  ones  are  just  vinyl  rips  taken  from  various  
torrents.
 
If
 
again
 
there’s
 
only
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
files
 
with
 
the
 
whole
 
album,
 
originally
 
attached
 
with
 
cue,
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
find
 
specific
 
cue
 
files
 
simply
 
searching
 
in
 
Google
 
for
 
its
 
specific
 
file
 
name
 
with
 
quotes
 
(file
 
list
 
is
 
below
 
track
 
list
 
there).
 
Of
 
course,
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
cut
 
your
 
album
 
manually,
 
or
 
even
 
make
 
your
 
own
 
cue
 
sheet
 
to
 
cut
 
the
 
album.
  Also  be  aware  that  sometimes  you  won’t  be  able  to  download  the  file,  and  it  won’t  appear  as  
FLAC,
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
press
 
CTRL+R
 
on
 
Network
 
before
 
starting
 
playing
 
the
 
file,
 
otherwise
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
close
 
and
 
reopen
 
the
 
tab
 
and
 
press
 
CTRL+R
 
in
 
Network
 
again.
 And  also,  such  files  can  reset  during  downloading  near  the  end  (maximum  size  of  
downloaded
 
file
 
cannot
 
exceed
 
1GB,
 
otherwise
 
it
 
gets
 
reset
 
for
 
some
 
reason).
 
To
 
prevent
 
it,
 
copy
 
the
 
download
 
link
 
from
 
your
 
browser,
 
and
 
paste
 
it
 
to
 
some
 
download
 
accelerator.
 
Even
 
free
 
BitComet
 
will
 
do
 
the
 
trick
 
since
 
it
 
supports
 
HTTP
 
multiple
 
connection
 
downloading.
 
If
 
you’re
 
lazy,
 
to
 
prevent
 
losing
 
at
 
least
 
these
 
1GB,
 
simply
 
open
 
the
 
still
 
downloaded
 
file
 
using
 
MPC-HC
 
and
 
Chrome
 
won’t
 
reset
 
the
 
file
 
size
 
after
 
it
 
starts
 
to
 
reset
 
the
 
whole
 
download
 
(because
 
the
 
file
 
cannot
 
be
 
deleted
 
now),
 
wait
 
for
 
the
 
reset
 
of
 
the
 
download,
 
now
 
just
 
make
 
a
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
file
 
and
 
rename
 
file
 
extension
 
to
 
FLAC
 
from
 
temporary
 
extension
 
added
 
by
 
e.g.
 
Chrome
 
during
 
downloading.
 
Now
 
you
 
can
 
stop
 
downloading
 
in
 
Chrome.
 
The
 
downside
 
is
 
-
 
the
 
moment
 
the
 
file
 
gets
 
reset
 
is
 
not
 
when
 
it
 
ends,
 
meaning
 
it’s
 
not
 
fully
 
complete.
 
But
 
mostly.
 
Of
 
course,
 
you
 
can
 
be
 
lucky
 
enough
 
to
 
find
 
the
 
original
 
torrent
 
with
 
the
 
files
 
and
 
simply
 
finish
 
downloading
 
by
 
verifying
 
checksums
 
of
 
existing
 
ones
 
in
 
P2P
 
client
 
(filenames
 
must
 
match
 
to
 
torrent
 
files,
 
simply
 
replace
 
them
 
and
 
find
 
option
 
to
 
verify
 
checksums).
  10b.  All  of  the  above  applies  to  https://www.flacit.com/ Looks  like  it  has  the  same  library  taken  from   adamsfile.com   which  is  also  a  warez  site  allowing  playing  files  and  downloading  them  using  the  method  
above.
 You  also  need  to  register  before  playing  any  file  there  (registration  is  free).   11.  http://flacmusicfinder.com/ But  it  has  a  small  library.   *.  FLAC  sites  listed  here  12.  Soulseek  -  but  it’s  simply  a  P2P  based  client,  so  carefully  with  that,  and  better  use  VPN  (good  one  at  best).  GUI  -  Nicotine+ and  Seeker  working  on  Android   13.  Rutracker  (the  same  advice  as  above)   14.  Chomikuj.pl  (use  their  search  engine,  eventually  Yandex,  Duckduckgo,  Bing)  -  free  50MB

week
 
for

of

separate
 
tracks
 
on
 
loose
 
as
 
well,
 
but
 
they
 
frequently
 
get
 
taken
 
down,
 
so
 
search
 
for
 
rather
