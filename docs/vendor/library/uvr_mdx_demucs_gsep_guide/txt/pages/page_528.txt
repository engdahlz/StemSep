     22  instrumental  albums  and  some  single  tracks  (DL)  -  hard  to  align  for  inversion,  even  for  lossless,  sometimes  time  shifts  every  verse,  possible  artefacts/bleeding  after  inversion  to  be  cleaned  further  with  models.

free)
  https://www.multitracks.com/ This  is  also  paid,  but  it  has  less  known  music  “those  are  covers  from  famous  songs,  but  all  in  multitracks.  And  from  what  I've  listened  to  so  far,  is  that  they  are  pretty  conservative.  The  vocals  all  seem  to  be  dry  and  none  seem  to  contain  bleed  so  far.  Also,  the  instrument  stems  are  proper  /  not  mixed  up  with  other  instrumentals.  The  stems  are  the  exact  same  duration.   All  in  all,  a  solid  dataset  right  off-the-bat  imo.
