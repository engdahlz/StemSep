[page 68/642]
     -  Unwa  released  a  new  beta  5  model  dedicated  for  vocals  |  Colab |  MSST-GUI |  UVR  instr https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-big/tree/main |  yaml:  big_beta5e.yaml  It  seems  to  fix  some  issues  with  trumpets  in  vocal  stem  (maxi74x1).  
It
 
handles
 
reverb
 
tails
 
much
 
better
 
(jarredou/Rage123).
  
“It's
 
noisy
 
and,
 
IDK,
 
grainy?
 
When
 
the
 
accompaniment
 
gets
 
too
 
loud.
 
(...)
 
Definitely
 
not
 
muddy
 
though,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
welcome
 
change
 
IMHO.
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
prefer
 
beta
 
4
 
overall”

“to
 
me,
 
the
 
noise
 
sounds
 
similar
 
to
 
how
 
VR
 
arch
 
models
 
sounded,
 
except
 
it's
 
not
 
poor
 
quality”
 
“Perhaps
 
a
 
phase
 
problem
 
is
 
occurring
 
(...)
 
The
 
noise
 
is
 
terrible
 
when
 
that
 
model
 
is
 
used
 
for
 
very
 
intense
 
songs”

 Phase  fixer  for  v1  inst  model  doesn’t  help  with  the  noise  here  (becruily).  
“it's
 
a
 
miracle
 
LMAO,
 
slow
 
instrumentation
 
like
 
violin,
 
piano,
 
not
 
too
 
many
 
drums...
 
 
it's
 
perfect...
 
but
 
unfortunately
 
it
 
can't
 
process
 
Pop
 
or
 
Rock
 
correctly”
 
gilliaan
 
 
“feel
 
so
 
full
 
AF,
 
but
 
it
 
has
 
noticeable
 
noise
 
similar
 
to
 
[Apollo]
 
lew's
 
vocal
 
enhancer”
 
“the
 
vocal
 
stem
 
of
 
beta5e
 
may
 
have
 
fullness
 
and
 
noise
 
level
 
like
 
duality
 
v1,
 
but
 
it
 
may
 
also
 
suffer
 
kind
 
of
 
robotic
 
phase
 
distortion,
 
yet
 
may
 
also
 
remove
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
bleed
 
present
 
in
 
other
 
melrofo's.”

“bigbeta5e
 
is
 
particularly
 
helpful
 
when
 
you
 
invert
 
an
 
instrumental
 
and
 
then
 
process
 
the
 
track
 
with
 
it.
 
It
 
really
 
keeps
 
the
 
quality.
 
Even
 
if
 
the
 
instrumental
 
was
 
a
 
lossy
 
mp3
 
inverted
 
to
 
a
 
lossless
 
flac
 
file,
 
it
 
cleans
 
it
 
up
 
without
 
making
 
a
 
mess.
 
(...)
 
some
 
songs
 
gets
 
their
 
instrumentals
 
leaked
 
online.
 
And
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
it's
 
a
 
lossy
 
160kbps
 
mp3
 
file
 
or
 
even
 
worse,
 
you
 
invert
 
that
 
instrumental
 
file
 
to
 
the
 
real
 
song
 
and
 
process
 
the
 
result
 
using
 
bigbeta5e
 
[to
 
clean
 
the
 
invert]”

“Ensemble
 
AVG
 
Big
 
Beta

+
 
Big
 
Beta
 
5e
 
is
 
really
 
good
 
to
 
reduce
 
the
 
noise
 
while
 
keeping
 
the
 
fullness”

Unwa
 
released
 
a
 
new
 
Inst
 
v1e
 
model
 
(“The
 
model
 
[yaml]
 
configuration
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
v1”)
 https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-Inst/tree/main |  Colab |  MSST-GUI |  UVR  instructions (added  in  Download  Center)  |  x-minus  (link for  premium  users)  |  MVSEP   “The  "e"  stands  for  emphasis,  indicating  that  this  is  a  model  that  emphasizes  fullness.”  
“However,
 
compared
 
to
 
v1,
 
while
 
the
 
fullness
 
score
 
has
 
increased,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
possibility
 
that
 
noise
 
has
 
also
 
increased.”
 
“lighter
 
compared
 
to
 
v2.”
 While  SDR-wise  it’s  worse than  previous  unwa’s  models,  it  has  the  best  full  fullness factor  (you  can  read  more  about  this  new  method  of  evaluation  later  in  this section).  The  phase  fixer  doesn’t  really  fix  the  noise  in  this  model  like  in  v1.  
 
Like
 
other
 
unwa
 
models,
 
this
 
can
 
also
 
confuse
 
flute,
 
trumpets
 
and
 
saxophone
 
with
 
vocals.
