    A:  That’s  easy  to  get  it  done  in  PyTorch,  just  use  EarlyStopping  after  the  overall  validation  
loss
 
computation
 
and
 
the
 
training
 
will
 
stop
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
patience
 
you
 
set
 
on
 
EarlyStopping…
   -  Colab by  jazzpear96  for  using  ZFTurbo's  MSS  training  script.  “I  will  add  inference  later  on,  but  for  now  you  can  only  do  the  training  process  with  this!”  -  Training  lots  of  epochs  on  Colab  might  be  extremely  tasking  -  for  free  users  they  currently  
only
 
give
 
slow
 
GPU
 
with
 
performance
 
of
 
around
 
RTX
 
3050
 
in
 
CUDA
 
but
 
with
 
11GB
 
of
 
VRAM.
 
It’s
 
only
 
good
 
enough
 
for
 
inference.
  Q:  how  can  I  train  a  heavier  MDX-NET  model  with  a  higher  frequency  cutoff  like  recent  UVR  
MDX
 
models?
  KimberleyJSN:  A:  these  are  the  settings  used  for  the  latest  MDX  models  you  can  change  them  at  
configs/model/ConvTDFNet_vocals.yaml
 
and
 
configs/experiment/multigpu_vocals.yaml
 overlap  -  3840  dim_f  -  3072  g  -  48  n_fft  -  7680   These  seem  to  be  actually  parameters  for  the  last  Kim  ft  other  instrumental  model,  while  e.g.  
half
 
of
 
MDX-UVR
 
HQ
 
models
 
without
 
cutoff
 
has
 
n_fft/self
 
n_fft
 
set
 
to
 
6144.
  Alternatively,  see  this  guide:  https://github.com/kuielab/mdx-net/issues/35#issuecomment-1082007368  You  also  need  to  be  aware  of  a  few  additional  things:   (Bas  Curtiz,  and  brackets  mine)  Few  [training]  key  points :   -  If  you  don't  have  a  monster  PC  incl.  a  top  range  GPU  [RTX  3080  min?]  (or  at  work),  don't  
even
 
consider.
 
[smaller
 
models
 
than
 
good
 
inst/vocs
 
with
 
fewer
 
epochs
 
of
 
around
 
50
 
might
 
be
 
still
 
in
 
your
 
range
 
though]
 -  If  you  don't  have  money  to  spent  renting  a  server  instead,  don't  even  consider.  -  If  you  aren't  tech-savy,  don't  even  consider.  -  [If  training]  a  particular  singer,  [then  does  it  have]  highly  100  tracks  with  original  
instrumental
 
+
 
vocal?
 -  IDK,  but  I  don't  think  that  will  be  enough  input  to  get  some  great  results,  you  could  try  
though
 
[good
 
models
 
so
 
far
 
have
 
varying
 
genres
 
and
 
artists
 
in
 
the
 
dataset,
 
not
 
just
 
one].
 -  If  you  need  some  help  setting  it  up,  Kimberly  (yes,  she's  the  one  who  created  Kim_vocal_1  
model,
 
based
 
on
 
an
