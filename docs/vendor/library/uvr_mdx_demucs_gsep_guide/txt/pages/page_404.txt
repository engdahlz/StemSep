Might  lack  HQ_3  and  voc_ft.  It  supports  batch  processing.  Works  with  a  folder  as  input  and  will  process  all  files  in  it.  In  "tracks_path"  must  be  a  folder  containing  (only)  audio  files  (not  the  direct  link  to  a  file).  But  the  below  might  still  work.)   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CO3KRvcFc1EuRh7YJea6DtMM6Tj8NHoB?usp=sharing (older  revision  with  also  auto  models  downloader,  but  with  manual  n_fft  dim_f  dim_t  parameters  setting  like  HV  added)   and  working  one  by  HV  linked  at  the  top:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/NaJeongMo/Colab-for-MDX_B/blob/main/MDX-Net_Colab.ipynb (new  one  by  HV  with  community  edits  -  2025)  ____________________________________________________________________   Old  update  from  before  model  downloader  implementation  (May  which  year?)   MDX  Colab with  separate  input  for  3  models  parameters,  so  you  don’t  need  to  change  models.py  every  time  you  switch  to  some  other  model.

  ___________________________  (older  Colab  instruction)  To  use  more  recent  MDX-UVR  models  in  Google  Colab:  1)  Use  and  install  this  Colab (new)  to  GDrive  at  least  once,  run  all  the  cells,  nothing  more  -  if  you  used  MDX  HV  Colab  (the  one  in  the  section  above)  on  your  specific  
Google
 
Drive
 
account
 
before,
 
ignore
 
this
 
step.
 
 2)  Copy  these  files  to  onnx  folder  in  MDX_Colab  on  your  GDrive  (inst1-3,  427)  (down)  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13SsV7b_kC6SqkICeX5wKhx-Z05uC8dLl (down)  3)  Overwrite  models.py  in  MDX_Colab  folder  by  provided  below  (not  for  new  Colab)  (compatible  with  inst1-3,  427,  Kim  vocal  and  other)  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945913897033023559/1036947933536473159/models.py (completely  different  one  with  self.n_fft  set  to  7680  -  incompatible  with  NET-1/9.x  and  496  models)  4)  Use  this  notebook  with  added  models   (the  same  as  the  link  in  point  1):
