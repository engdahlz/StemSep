    In  Colab  you  can  change  chunks  to  10  if  your  track  is  below  5:00  minutes.  It  will  take  a  bit  
more
 
time,
 
but
 
the
 
quality
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
cleaner,
 
but
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
can
 
kick
 
in
 
(esp.
 
short
 
sudden
 
ones).
 Be  aware  that  MDX  Colabs  for  single  models  have  16  bit  output.   And  also  noise  cancellation  implementation  for  MDX  models  in  kae  and  HV  Colab  can  differ  
a
 
bit,
 
plus
 
there
 
is
 
also
 
separate
 
denoise
 
method
 
available
 
as
 
separate
 
model.
 
 Code  for  denoise  method  in  HV  Colab  here.   As  for  any  other  settings,  just  use  defaults  since  they're  the  best  and  updated.   Just  for  a  vocal  it’s  one  of  the  best  free  solutions  on  the  market,  very  close  to  the  result  of  
paid
 
and
 
(partly)

(but
 
the
 
old
 
models
 
are
 
trained
 
at
 
14.7
 
kHz
 
[NET-X
 
a.k.a.
 
9.x]
 
in
 
comparison
 
to

models,
 
and
 
17.7kHz
 
in
 
newer

like

and

 In  most  cases  MDX-UVR  inverted  models  give  less  bleeding  than  VR  (especially  on  bassy  
voice),
 
while
 
occasionally
 
the
 
result
 
can
 
be
 
worse
 
comparing
 
to
 
VR
 
above,
 
especially
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
hi-end
 
frequencies
 
quality,
 
but
 
in
 
general,
 
MDX
 
with
 
UVR
 
team
 
models
 
behaves
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
vocals
 
and
 
instrumentals.
 
 Even  instrumental  from  inverted  vocals  from  vocal  models  gets  less  impaired  than  in  VR,  
since
 
vocal
 
filtering
 
is
 
less
 
aggressive,
 
but
 
with
 
even
 
more
 
bleeding
 
in
 
some
 
cases.
 
Depends
 
on
 
a
 
song.
  You  can  support  the  creators  of  UVR  and  the  newest  MDX  model  is  also  available  on  https://www.patreon.com/uvr https://boosty.to/uvr to  visit  https://x-minus.pro/ to  get  an  online  version  of  MDX  there  as  well  (with  exclusive  paid  models).   At  least  paid  x-minus  subscription  allows  you  to  use  MDX  HQ_2  498  (or  HQ_3  already)

  Outdated  Alternatively  you  can  experiment  with  9662  model  and  ensemble  it  with  the  latest  UVR  5's  4  
band
 
V2
 
with
 
-a
 
min_mag
 
as
 
Anjok
 
suggested
 
(but
 
it
 
was
 
when
 
new
 
models
 
weren't
 
released
 
yet).
 Remotely  I  only  know  about  old  Colab  which  ensembles  any  two  audio  files,  but  it  uses  old  
algorithm
 
if
 
I'm
 
not
 
mistaken,
 
so
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
as
 
good
 
(better
 
use
 
the
 
ensemble
 
Colab
 
linked
 
at
 
the
 
very
 
top
 
of
 
the
