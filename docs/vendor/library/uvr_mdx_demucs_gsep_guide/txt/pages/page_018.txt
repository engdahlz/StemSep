    -  “I  added  new  version  of  MVSep  Organ  (organ,  other)  model:  "BS  Roformer  (SDR  organ:  
5.08)".

from
 
3.05
 
to
 
5.08.

In  places  
where
 
the
 
organ
 
sound
 
was
 
not
 
picked
 
up
 
before,
 
it
 
is
 
now

  -  Google  Colab  now  allows  pinning  your  environment  to  specific  version  having  the  same  
versions
 
of
 
packages,
 
so
 
maybe
 
your
 
notebook
 
won't
 
break
 
in
 
the
 
future
 
due
 
to
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
environment
 
introduced
 
by
 
Google
 
in
 
the
 
Colab
 
with
 
package
 
updates.
 For  now  there  is  only  2025.07  and  the  latest  environment  to  choose  from,  and  it's  hard  to  tell  
if
 
e
 
g.
 
2025.07
 
environment
 
will
 
be
 
gradually
 
replaced
 
along
 
the
 
time
 
while
 
new
 
changes
 
to
 
the
 
latest
 
Colab
 
environment
 
will
 
be
 
made:

  -  Essid  reevaluated  GAudio  (a.k.a.  GSEP)  for  the  leaderboard.  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/9095 Inst  fullness:  28.83,  bleedless:  31.18,  SDR:  12.59  The  result  would  rather  cover  my  observations  that  instrumentals  rather  have  gotten  worse  
over
 
the
 
years
 
(at
 
least
 
since
 
the
 
last
 
2023
 
Bas'
 
evaluation
 
or
 
even
 
earlier,
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
certain
 
songs).
 
But
 
it
 
appears
 
that
 
the
 
vocals
 
might
 
got
 
better.
 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/multisong_leaderboard?algo_name_filter=Gsep&sort=instrum&ranking_metrics= Despite  the  fact  the  metrics  are  worse  than  even  the  least  bleedless  free  community  models  
like
 
even
 
V1e,
 
for
 
specific
 
songs
 
where
 
bleeding
 
doesn't
 
occur
 
so
 
badly,
 
GSEP
 
might
 
be
 
still
 
interesting
 
too
 
try
 
out
 
to
 
some
 
limited
 
extend,
 
being
 
a
 
different
 
architecture,
 
sounding
 
maybe
 
less
 
filtered.
 
Also,
 
mixdown
 
of
 
multi
 
stem
 
extraction
 
instead,
 
should
 
rather
 
have
 
bigger
 
bleedless
 
metric,
 
but
 
since
 
the
 
appearance
 
of
 
instrumental
 
Roformers,
 
GSEP
 
relevance
 
for
 
separation
 
is
 
rather
 
faded.

  -  fabio06844  shared  his  method  for  “very  clean  and  full”  instrumental  lately.  1)  Go  to  MVSep  and  separate  your  song  with  the  latest  Karaoke  BS-Roformer  by  MVSep  
Team
 2)  On  its  instrumental  stem  use  DEBLEED-MelBand-Roformer  (by  unwa/97chris)
