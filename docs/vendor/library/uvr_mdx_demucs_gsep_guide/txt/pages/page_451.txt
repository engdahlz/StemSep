    Site:  https://www.ripple.club/  BS-RoFormer   Used  architecture  in  Capcut/Ripple  (now  defunct).  Their  paper  was  published  and  later  
reimplemented
 
by
 
lucidrains
 
for
 
training
 
and
 
inferencing:
 https://github.com/lucidrains/BS-RoFormer Later,  Mel-Band  RoFormer based  on  band  split  was  released,  which  is  faster,  but  doesn't  provide  such  high  SDR  as  BS.  Mel  variant  might  require  some  revision  of  the  code,  and  its  
paper
 
might
 
lack
 
some
 
features
 
need
 
to
 
keep
 
up
 
SDR-wise
 
with
 
extremely
 
slow
 
BS
 
original
 
variant.
 
On
 
paper,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
BS-Roformer,
 
but
 
for
 
some
 
reason,
 
models
 
trained
 
with
 
Mel
 
have
 
worse
 
results
 
than
 
with
 
BS-Roformer
 
(so
 
probably
 
problem
 
with
 
reimplementation
 
from
 
paper).
 
Kim
 
reworked
 
her
 
config,
 
so
 
the
 
results
 
with
 
Mel
 
models
 
improved,
 
but
 
still
 
are
 
a
 
tad
 
lower
 
than
 
BS-Roformer.
 
ZFTurbo
 
includes
 
training
 
and
 
inference
 
of
 
Roformers
 
in
 
his
 
repository
 
on
 
GitHub.
 For  more  information,  check  the  training section.   About  ByteDance    Winners  of  MDX23  competition.  They  said  at  the  beginning,  that  it  utilizes  novel  arch  (so  no  
weighting/ensembling
 
of
 
existing
 
models).

times

so
 
good
 
instrumentals,
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
once

by
 
someone
 
who
 
heard

they
 
came
 
a
 
long
 
way
 
lately.
 
It's
 
all
 
about
 
their
 
politics.
 
It's
 
a
 
Chinese
 
company
 
responsible
 
for
 
TikTok,
 
famous
 
for
 
d**k
 
moves
 
outside
 
China
 
-
 
manipulating
 
their
 
algorithms
 
-
 
encourage
 
of
 
stupidity
 
outside
 
China,
 
and
 
greedy,
 
wellness-centered
 
attitudes
 
for
 
users
 
in
 
China
 
(the
 
app
 
is
 
currently
 
banned
 
in
 
China),
 
manipulating
 
their
 
algorithms
 
to
 
promote
 
only
 
black-white
 
relationships
 
in
 
western
 
countries,
 
spying
 
on
 
users
 
copying
 
their
 
clipboard,
 
spying
 
even
 
on
 
journalists
 
to
 
find
 
their
 
sources
 
of
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
company,
 
unauthorized
 
remote
 
access
 
to
 
TikTok
 
user
 
data
 
from
 
China,
 
and
 
also,
 
a
 
subject
 
to
 
ban
 
in
 
US
 
and
 
other
 
countries
 
for
 
bad
 
influence
 
on
 
children,
 
data
 
infringement
 
by
 
storing
 
non-China
 
users
 
data
 
directly
 
on
 
their
 
servers
 
which
 
is
 
against
 
the
 
law
 
of
 
many
 
countries
 
(there
 
were
 
some
 
actions
 
taken
 
on
 
it
 later).  Decompiling  TikTok  analysis (tons  of  spying  improper  behavior  of  the  app).  Currently,  Bytedance  is  only  around  40%  owned  by  founders,  Chinese  investors,  and  their  employees  
and
 
the
 
rest
 
(60%)
 
state
 
global
 
investors
 
(incl.
 
lots
 
of
 
American)
 
and
 
is
 
pushed
 
to

stakes
 
to
 
US
 
risking
 
US
 
ban
 
on
 
the
 
app.
  They  said,  the  CEO,  told  them  to  hold  this  ByteDance  arch  for  two  years  for  themselves.  
Initially
 
they
 
had
 
plans
 
to
 
release
 
it
 
in
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
app,
 
firstly
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
June,
 
later
 
something
 
was
 
planned
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
year,
 
later
 
they
 
said
 
something
 
about
 
two
 
years
 
(maybe
 
more
 
about
 
open
 
sourcing,
 
but
 
we
 
can't
 
have
 
our
 
hopes
 
high).
 
Previously,
 
they
 
said
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
open
 
sourcing/releasing
 
was
 
stuck
 
in
 
their
 
legal
 
department.
 
Later
 
they
 
told
 
they
 
used
 
MUSDBHQ+500
 
songs
 
for
 
their
 
dataset.
 
These
 
500
 
songs
 
could
 
have
 
been
 
obtained
 
illegally
 
for
 
training
 
(although
 
everyone
 
does
 
it),
 
but
 
they
 
might
 
be
 
extremely
 
cautious
 
about
 
it
 
(or
 
it's
 
just
 
an
 
excuse).
 
Eventually,
 
they
 
released
 
Ripple
 
and
 
Capcut.
 
Then
 
they
 
released
