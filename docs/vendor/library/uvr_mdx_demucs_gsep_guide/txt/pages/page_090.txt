    Although  your  mileage  will  still  vary  on  a  song,  e.g.  “For  most  of  the  songs  I  tried  it  worked  
very
 
well.
 
Example:
 
"From
 
Souvenirs
 
to
 
Souvenirs"
 
by
 
Demis
 
Roussos.
 
It's
 
the
 
only
 
model
 
as
 
of
 
now
 
which
 
can
 
seperate
 
the
 
lead
 
from
 
the
 
back
 
vocals
 
correctly”

  -  Izotope  RX11  officially  released.  Seeing  by  the  unencrypted  onnx  model  file  names,  it  uses  
demucs_ft
 
for
 
stem
 
separation
 
now,
 
but
 
maybe
 
it’s
 
not
 
the
 
same
 
model
 
as
 
the
 
public
 
one,
 
as
 
all
 
stems
 
“null
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
input
 
stereo
 
which
 
is
 
something
 
standard
 
demucsht
 
doesn't
 
appear
 
to
 
do
 
(...)
 
mdx
 
seems
 
to
 
always
 
null
 
luckily.”
 
The
 
feature
 
still
 
doesn’t
 
use
 
CUDA/Nvidia
 
GPU
 
for
 
processing
 
(and
 
there’s
 
no
 
such
 
option
 
anywhere).
 
It’s
 
still
 
an
 
improvement
 
over
 
RX8-10
 
as
 
they
 
used
 
in-house
 
Spleeter
 
22kHz
 
models
 
before.
 Comparison  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUEmvneerc New  features (e.g.  clean  up  dialogue  in  real  time).   -  Logic  Pro  11  now  incorporates  a  Stem  Splitter.  Results  vary  from  good  to  bad  (and  worse  than  known  solutions)  depending  on  a  song.   -  Mel-Roformer  De-crowd  model  added  on  x-minus.pro.  Results  are  more  accurate  than  in  the  old  MDX  model.   -  GSEP has  been  updated.  Free  option  for  all  stems  has  been  removed.  There's  only  a  20  minutes  free  trial.  WAV  is  only  
for
 
paid
 
users.
  Vocals  and  all  other  stems  (including  instrumentals/others)  are  paid,  and  length  for  each  
stem
 
is
 
taken
 
from
 
your
 
account
 
separately
 
for
 
each
 
model.
  No  credit  is  not  required  for  the  trial.   For  free,  only  mp3  output  and  10  minutes  input  limit.  For  paid  users  there's  a  20  minutes  limit,  and  mp3/wav  output,  plus  paid  users  have  faster  
queue,
 
shareable
 
links,
 
and
 
long
 
term
 
results
 
storage.
  Pricing  7$/60  minutes   16$/240  minutes   50$/1200  minutes   Seems  like  there  weren't  many  changes  in  the  model  (if  there  weren’t  even  more  vocal  residues  introduced  since  then).  People  still  have  similar  complaints  to  it.  Comparison video.   There  was  an  average  of  0.13  SDR  increase  for  mp3  output  and  first  19  songs  from  
multisong
 
dataset
 
evaluation,
 
but
 
judging
 
by
 
no
 
audible
 
difference
 
for
 
most
 
people,
 
they
 
could
 
simply
 
change
 
some
 
parameters
 
for
 
inference.
