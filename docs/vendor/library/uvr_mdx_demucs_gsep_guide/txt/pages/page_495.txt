    than  single  files.  Mp3  files  and  those  files  which  allow  preview,  can  be  downloaded  for  free  
with
 
JDownloader,
 
but
 
occasionally
 
some
 
of
 
such
 
files
 
might
 
not
 
work
 
in
 
JDownloader,
 
and
 
they’ll
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
downloaded
 
manually.
     15.  https://music.binimum.org  16.  https://monochrome.tf  17.  https://dab.yeet.su (requires  free  account  creation)   18.  Simply  search  for  the  track  on  Google,  or  even  better  -  Yandex,  Duckduckgo,  eventually  
Bing,
 
because
 
Google
 
frequently
 
blacklists
 
some
 
sites
 
or
 
search
 
entries.
 
Also,
 
your
 
specific
 
provider
 
may
 
cut
 
connection
 
to
 
some
 
sites,
 
so
 
you'll
 
be
 
forced
 
to
 
use
 
VPN
 
in
 
those
 
cases
 
when
 
a
 
search
 
engine
 
shows
 
up
 
a
 
result
 
from
 
a
 
site
 
you
 
cannot
 
open.
  19.  Redtopia  archives  on  torrent  sites   20.  YouTube  Music  -  higher  bitrate  (256kbps)  than  max  128/160kbps  on  regular  YT  for  
Opus/webm
 
(20kHz)
 
and
 
AAC/M4A
 
128kbps
 
(16kHz).
 
Similarly,
 
like
 
in
 
Spotify
 
-
 
it
 
can
 
possess
 
some
 
exclusive
 
files
 
which
 
are
 
unavailable
 
in
 
lossless
 
form
 
on
 
any
 
other
 
platform,
 
but
 
most
 
on
 
YTM
 
are
 
available
 
losslessly
 
on
 
other
 
streaming
 
services,
 
so
 
use
 
them
 
instead.
 If  you  have  YouTube  Premium  you  apparently  can  download  files  from  it  if  you  provide  your  
token
 
properly
 
to
 
yt-dl.
 Maybe  logging  into  Google  account  with  enabled  premium  in  JDownloader  2  will  do  the  trick  
as
 
well.
 Anyway,  Divolt  bot  (or  any  other  currently  available)  will  work  too.   ______  Outdated/closed/defunct   0)  us.deezer.squid.wtf |  (out  of  order  for  now,  Deezer  only;  search  didn’t  respond  before)  eu.deezer.squid.wtf/ (also  offline)  -  works  for  queries,  not  URLs,  single  songs  or  albums,  if  you  don’t  check  the  “Save  songs  on  download”  (supported  on  Chrome)  you  need  to  press

manually
 
after

(so
 
once
 
you’re

sometimes

consequently

you

Also,
 
sometimes
