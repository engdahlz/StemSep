Not  so  good  vocals.   (for  older  models)  The  combination  of  3  different  aggression  settings  (mostly  the  most  
aggressive
 
in
 
busy
 
mix
 
parts)
 
gives
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
for
 
Childish
 
Gambino
 
-
 
Algorithm
 
vs
 
our
 
top
 
ensemble
 
settings
 
so
 
far.
 
But
 
it's
 
still
 
far
 
from
 
ideal
 
(and
 
[not
 
only]
 
the
 
most
 
aggressive
 
one
 
makes
 
instruments
 
very
 
muffled
 
[but
 
vocals
 
are
 
better
 
cancelled
 
too],
 
although
 
our
 
separation
 
makes
 
it
 
even
 
a
 
bit
 
worse
 
in
 
more
 
busy
 
mix
 
fragment).
 
 As  for  drums  -  better  than  GSEP,  worse  than  Demucs  4  ft  32,  although  a  bit  better  hihat.  Not  
too
 
easy
 
track
 
and
 
already
 
shows
 
some
 
diffrences
 
between
 
just
 
GSEP
 
and
 
Demucs
 
when
 
the
 
latter
 
has
 
more
 
muffled
 
hi-hats,
 
but
 
better
 
snare,
 
and
 
it
 
rather
 
happens
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
times
  (old)  Samples:   Instrumental Drums  Also,  it  automatically  picks  the  first  fragment  for  preview  when  vocal  appears,  so  it  is  difficult  
to
 
write
 
something
 
like
 
AS
 
Tool
 
for
 
that
 
(probably
 
manipulations
 
by
 
manual
 
mixing
 
of
 
fake
 
vocals
 
would
 
be
 
needed).
 
Actually,
 
smudge
 
wrote
 
one.
  Very  promising  results  even  for  earlier  version.   They  wrote  once  somewhere  about  limited  previews  for  stem  mode  (for  more  than  2  mode)  
and
 
free
 
credits,
 
but
 
haven’t
 
encountered
 
it
 
yet.
  They’re  accused  by  aufr33  to  use  some  of  UVR  models  for  2  stems  in  the  past,  without  
crediting
 
the
 
source
 
(and
 
taking
 
money
 
for
 
that).
  Now  new,  better  models  are  released.  Better  instrumentals  than  in  UVR/MVSep,  and  not  the  
same
 
models.
  It  used  to  be  possible  to  get  free  30  seconds  samples  on  dango.ai,  but  recently  5  samples  
are
 
available
 
for
 
free
