  2025  metrics  for  2  stems  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/9095  (outdated)  About  its  SDR  10.02  SDR for  vocal  model  (vs  Byte  Dance  8.079)  on  seemingly  MDX21  chart,  but  non-SDR  rated  newer  model(s)  were  available  from  09.06.22,  and  later  by  the  end  of  July,  and  now  
new
 
model
 
is
 
released
 
since
 
6
 
September
 
(there
 
were
 
4
 
or
 
5
 
different
 
vocal/instrumental
 
models
 
in
 
total
 
so
 
far,
 
the
 
last
 
introduced
 
somewhere
 
in
 
September
 
and
 
no
 
models
 
update
 was  performed  with  later  UI  update).  MVSEP  SDR  comparison chart  on  their  dataset,  shows  it's  currently  around  SDR  9  for  both  instrumental  and  vocals,  but  I  think  evaluation  done  on  demixing  challenge (first  model)  was  more  precise.  Be  aware  that  GSEP  causes  issue  of  cancelling  different  sounds  which  cannot  be  found  in  any  stem.   Since  May  2024  update  there  was  an  average  of  0.13  SDR  increase  for  mp3  output  and  first

songs

multisong
 
dataset
 
evaluation,
 
but
 
judging
 
by
 
no
 
audible
 
difference
 
for
 
most
 
people,
 
they
 
could
 
simply
 
change
 
some
 
parameters
 
of
 
inference.
 
Actually,
 
it’s
 
more
 
muddy
 
now,
 
but
 
in
 
some
 
songs
 
there
 
are
 
a
 
bit
 
less
 
of
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
and
 
in
 
other
 
songs,
 
noticeably
 
more.
 
Inverting
 
the
 
mixture
 
with
 
vocals
 
in
 
WAV
 
will
 
muffle
 
the
 
sound
 
in
 
overall,
 
e.g.
 
snares,
 
esp.
 
in
 
places
 
of
 
these
 
residues,
 
but
 
the
 
residues
 
will
 
disappear
 
as
 
well.
  Uncheck  vocals  to  download  WAV  file  if  WAV  download  doesn't  work,  and  uncheck  instrumental  to  download  vocals  in  WAV  -  don't  check  all  stems  if  you  can't  download  WAV  at  all  and  download  window  simply  
disappears.
  If  you  still  can’t  download  your  WAV  files,  go  to  Chrome  DevTools>Network  before  starting  
downloading,
 
and
 
press
 
CTR+R,
 
now
 
start
 
download.
 
Now
 
both
 
stems
 
should
 
be
 
shown
 
in
 
DevTools>Network,
 
starting
 
with
 
input
 
file
 
name,
 
e.g.
 
instrumental
 
with
 
ending
 
name
 
“result_accom.wav”
 
(usually
 
marked
 
as
 
“fail”
 
in
 
State
 
column
 
and
 
xhr
 
as
 
type),
 
click
 
the

with
 
right
 
mouse
 
button
 
and
 
choose
 
Open
 
in
 
new
 
tab.
