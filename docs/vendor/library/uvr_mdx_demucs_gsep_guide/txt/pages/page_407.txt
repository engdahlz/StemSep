    20)  ModuleNotFoundError:  No  module  named  'models'  Sometimes  switching  models.py  doesn’t  work  correctly  (especially  during  working  on  
previously
 
shared
 
Colab
 
folder
 
with
 
editing
 
privileges)
 
in
 
that
 
case,
 
check
 
Colab’s
 
file
 
manager
 
if
 
models.py
 
is
 
actually
 
present
 
after
 
you’ve
 
made
 
a
 
change
 
on
 
GDrive.
 
If
 
not,
 
rename
 
it
 
to
 
models.py
 
(it
 
might
 
have
 
been
 
renamed
 
to
 
something
 
else).
 21)  Collection  of  all  three  models.py  for  all  models  for  your  comfort:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J35h9RYhPFk8dH-vShSW_AUharXY1YsN?usp=sharing 22)  Main_406  vocal  model  https://mega.nz/file/dcREzKTR#PYKk3s1NPicC3mBBYH8ejC2rK_Im3sAj0p9xcOi1cpE         "compensate":  1.075,          "mdx_dim_f_set":  3072,          "mdx_dim_t_set":  8,          "mdx_n_fft_scale_set":  7680,       Models  include  here  only:  baseline,  instrumental  models:  415  (inst_1),  418  (inst_2),  464

vocal

Kim’s

model
 
(old)
 
(instrumental
 
should
 
be
 
automatically
 
made
 
by
 
inversion
 
option,
 
but
 
it’s
 
not
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
one
 
for
 
it)
 
and
 
292
 
and
 
403
 
full

If
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
older
 
9.7
 
models,
 
use
 
old
 
HV
 
Colab
 
above.
  464/inst  3  should  be  the  best  in  most  cases  for  instrumentals  and  vocals  than  previous  9.x  
models,
 
but
 
depending,
 
even
 
in
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
cases,
 
418
 
can
 
achieve
 
better
 
results,
 
while
 
full
 
band
 
403
 
might
 
give
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
inst3/464
 
in
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
cases.
  Settings   max_mag  is  for  vocals  min_mag  for  instrumentals  default  (deleted  from  the  new  HV  Colab,  still  in  Kae  Colab  above)   But  "min  mag  solve  some  unwanted  vocal  soundings,  but  instrumental  [is]  more  muffled  and  
less
 
detailed."
 Also  check  out  “default”  setting  (whatever  is  that,  compare  checksums  if  not  one  of  these).  Chunks   As  low  as  possible,  or  disabled.   Equivalent  of  min_mag  in  UVR  is  min_spec.   Be  aware  that  UVR5,  opposed  to  MDX  Google  Colab,  applies  cutoff  to  inverted  output,  
matching
 
the
 
frequency
 
of
 
training
 
frequency
 
e.g.
 
17.7kHz
 
for
 
inst
 
1
 
and
 
3
 
models.
 
It
 
was
 
to
 
avoid
 
some
 
noise
 
and
 
vocal
 
leftovers.
 
You
 
might
 
have
 
to
 
apply
 
it
 
manually.
