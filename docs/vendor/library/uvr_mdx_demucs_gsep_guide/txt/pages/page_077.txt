     It's  not  a  final  model  yet,  and  the  model  is  in  training  from  April  and  is  still  in  progress.   It  seems  to  be  muddier  than  HQ_4  (and  more  than  Kim’s  and  MVSEP’s  Mel-Roformer),  it  
has
 
less
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
than
 
before,
 
but
 
more
 
than
 
Kim
 
Mel-Roformer.
 
Sometimes
 
struggles
 
with
 
reverb.
 "Almost  perfectly  placed  all  the  guitar  in  the  vocal  stem"  it  might  get  potentially  fixed  in  the  
final
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
model,
 
which
 
is
 
planned
 
for
 
release
 
in
 
the
 
mid-November

  The  model  is  not  available  in  UVR  yet  (only  on  uvronline.app)   -  Using  the  UVR  Roformer beta  patch  for  Mac  doesn’t  allow  you  to  choose  the  Roformer  parameter  to  check  for  manually  copied  Roformer  models  to  UVR  like:  Kim  Mel-Roformer  or  
unwa’s
 
Roformer,
 
and
 
only
 
config
 
name
 
can
 
be
 
chosen,
 
but
 
no

button
 
is
 
available
 
to
 make  the  model  work.  Place  corresponding hash-named  file  to  models\MDX_Net_Models\model_data  after  placing  model  file  to  MDX_Net_Models  and  
non-hased
 
model’s
 
yaml
 
to
 
mdx_c_configs
 
and
 
start
 
the

  -  Aufr33  released  files  for  the  new  UVR  de-reverb  model  made  with  jarredou   (based  on  VR  5.1  arch).  “1.  Download  this and  unzip  into  your  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover  folder  2.  Select  VR  architecture  and  DeReverb  model  from  the  menu  3.  Set  the  parameters  as  shown  here”   (PS:  Dry,  Bal:  0,  VR  5.1,  Out:32/128/Param:  4band_v4_ms_fulband  -  An  already  existing  json  config  file  in  modelparams  folder  has  the  same  checksum)   Bas  Curtiz’  “Conclusion  so  far:  -  MDX[23C]  De-Reverb  seems  to  be  cleaner,  takes  the  reverb  away,  also  between  the  
words,
 whereas  VR  leaves  a  little  reverb  -  [The  new]  VR  De-Reverb  seems  to  sound  more  natural,  maybe  therefore  actually.  Also,  MDX  tends  to  'pinch'  some  stuff  away  to  the  background,  which  sounds  unnatural.   This  is  just  based  on  my  experience  with  3  songs/comparisons,  but  both  points  are  a  pattern.  Overall,  they're  both  great  when  u  compare  them  against  the  original  reverbed/untouched  vocals.”  Video  -  SCNet  Large  vocal  model  on  MVSep  published.  Multisong  dataset:  SDR  vocals:  10.74  SDR  other:  17.05  “just  like  the  new  bs  roformer  ft  model,  but  with  more  bleed.  [BS]  catches  vocals  with  more  
harmonies/bgv”
