    ps  2:  if  there  are  two  singers  singing  the  same  melody  and  they  don't  harmonise  each  other  -  
the
 
model
 
will
 
most
 
likely
 
consider
 
both
 
singers
 
as
 
one
 
lead
 
vocal
 
(again
 
in
 
rare
 
cases
 
one
 
singer
 
could
 
be
 
left)

  -  (MVSEP)  “New  Karaoke  model  based  on  SCNet  XL  IHF  was  added  on  site  in  "MVSep

(lead/back
 
vocals)".
 
Name
 
of
 
model
 
"SCNet
 
XL
 
IHF
 
by
 
becruily
 
(SDR:
 9.53,  metrics)".  It  has  slightly  worse  metrics  than  the  top  Roformer  model,  but  since  it's  different  architecture  it  can  give  better  results  in  some  cases  where  the  Rofo  failed.  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250908072226-f0bb276157-mixture.wav”  -  ZFTurbo  Iirc  it's  BVE  or  IHF  unpublic  ZFTurbo  model  retrain,  and  ckpt  won't  be  public  till  further  
notice,
 
as
 
becruily
 
said.
 “SCNet  is  more  bleedy  in  general  despite  me  trying  to  reduce  the  leakage  it's  recommended  for  busy  songs,  often  captures  proper  lead  vocals  better  than  Roformer.  
Another
 
use
 
case
 
is
 
to
 
ensemble
 
it
 
with
 
Roformer
 
to
 
improve
 
fullness”

 “Oh,  might  be  related  to  the  lead  vocals  panning,  it  seems  this  model  doesn't  like  when  it's  
not
 
center
 
(...)
 
I'm
 
indeed
 
noticing
 
this
 
model
 
works
 
really
 
great
 
on
 
some
 
songs
 
that
 
the
 
Mel
 
Rofo
 
Karaoke
 
had
 
trouble
 
with
 
(...)
 
I
 
noticed
 
that,
 
this
 
model,
 
instead
 
of
 
creating
 
crossbleeding
 
between
 
LVs
 
and
 
BVs,
 
make
 
them
 
both
 
quieter.
 
I
 
prefer
 
that
 
compared
 
to
 
previous
 
models
 
Plus,
 
it
 
handle
 
songs
 
which
 
have
 
lead
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
sides
 
and
 
BVs
 
also
 
in
 
the
 
sides
 
better”
 To  fix  bleed  in  back-instrum  stem,  use  “Extract  vocals  first,  but,  “I  noticed  a  pattern  that  if  you  
hear
 
the
 
lead
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
back-instrum
 
track
 
already
 
(SCNet
 
bleed),
 
dont
 
try
 
to
 
use
 
Extract
 
vocals
 
first
 
because
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
even
 
more
 
lead
 
vocal
 
bleed”

 Since  the  Mel  Kar  Becruily's  model,  the  dataset  is  “larger”  now,  but  still  not  “great”,  and  it  
might
 
get
 
eventually
 
fixed,
