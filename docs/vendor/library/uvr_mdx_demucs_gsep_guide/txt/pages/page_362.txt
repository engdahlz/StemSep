    -  “In  the  last  438  vocals  are  really  nice,  also  backing  vocals.  Unfortunately,  we  can  hear  
more
 
music
 
noises,
 
but
 
voices
 
are
 
amazing”
 
(it's
 
good
 
for
 
cleaning
 
artifacts
 
from
 
inverts).

 -  Beta  390  is  better  than  340.  Instruments  are  cleaner  but  have  more  vocal  disturbances.  -  I've  tried  a  combination  of  MDX  390  -  UVR  min_mag_k.  Not  really  bad  at  all”.  -  "406  keeps  most  of  these  trumpets/saxes  or  other  similar  instruments,  and  ensembling  with  
max_mag
 
means
 
it
 
combines
 
it
 
with
 
UVR
 
instrumental
 
which
 
already
 
keeps
 
such
 
instruments,
 
so
 
you
 
get
 
best
 
of
 
both
 
worlds".
 Instrumental  models:  -  430  or  418  are  worth  checking.    Update  17.11.2021  -  older  public  UVR  9.6  and  9.7  vocal  models  (but  still  decent)  for  MDX  are  described  in  "MDX-Net  with  UVR  team"  section.   Upcoming  UVR5  updates  (outdated)   Since  the  training  of  MDX  September  models  is  completed,  some  older  beta  models  might  
not
 
be
 
available
 
anymore.
 As  of  the  middle  of  September  a  new  VR  model  was  in  training,  but  cancelled  due  to  not  
"conclusive"
 
results,
 
although
 
later
 
a
 
new
 
VR
 
model
 
was
 
released.
  "these  models  will  be  next:  1.  Saxophone  model  for  UVR.  2.  "Karokee"  model  for  MDX  v2."   Also,  completely  rewritten  UVR5  GUI  version.   Among  many  new  features  -  new  denoiser  for  MDX  models  available  and  new  Demucs  4  
models
 
(SDR
 
9).
