    To  install  models  from  external  sources  (those  unavailable  in  Download  Center)  you  can  
copy
 
the
 
model
 
file
 
to
 
models\MDX_Net_Models
 
and
 
.yaml
 
config
 
to
 
models\model_data\mdx_c_configs,
 
then
 
after
 
choosing
 
the
 
model
 
in
 
the
 
app,
 
press
 
yes
 
to
 
recognize
 
the
 
model,
 
wait
 
a
 
while.
 
In
 
older
 
beta
 
check
 
also
 
“roformer
 
model”
 
option
 
when
 
asked
 
for
 
configuration
 
file
 
and
 
confirm
 
(you
 
cannot
 
press
 
confirm
 
or
 
check
 
the
 
option
 
on
 
the
 
oldest
 
Mac
 
Roformer
 
patch,
 
the
 
issue
 
is
 
explained
 
below,
 
and
 
fixed
 
in
 
newer
 
versions).
 (or  step  by  step)   Misc   -  You  might  want  to  decrease  default  chunk_size  in  Edit  Model  Param  (or  yaml)  for  
AMD/Intel
 
GPUs
 
with
 
VRAM
 
lower
 
than
 
16GB
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
memory
 
errors
 
with
 
GPU
 Conversion  enabled  or  your  separation  is  stuck  on  e.g.  5%  (read  more  in  Common  issues later  below)   -  How  would  I  assign  a  yaml  config  to  an  Apollo  model  on  the  new  UVR  [patch]?  
 “1.  Open  the  Apollo  models  folder  2.  Drop  the  model  into  the  folder  3.  From  the  Apollo  models  folder,  drop  the  yaml  into  the  model_configs  directory  4.  From  the  GUI,  choose  the  model  you  just  added  and  if  the  model  is  not  recognized,  a  
pop-up
 
window
 
will
 
appear,
 
and
 
you'll
 
have
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
choose
 
the
 
yaml
 
to
 
associate
 
with
 
the
 
model.”

Anjok
  -  “batch_size  =  2  (not  less  or  more)”  -  “1  can  lead  to  some  clicks  in  output,  while  with  
batch_size>=2,
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
clicks.
 
Clicks
 
are
 
obvious
 
in
 
low
 
freq
 
of
 
log
 
spectrogram”
 edit.  iirc  clicks  with  batch_size=1  could  have  been  fixed  (at  least  were  with  MSST  from  which  
the
 
inference
 
code
 
was
 
implemented
 
in
 
newer
 
UVR
 
patches,
 
but
 
iirc
 
it
 
wasn’t
 
used,
 
and
 
later
 
the
 
clicks
 
were
 
fixed
 
in
 
MSST).
  -  Segment  size  in  the  UVR  UI  does  nothing  for  these  Roformer  models  due  to  Advanced  
arch
 
options
 
being
 
set
 
by
 
default
 
to
 
Segment
 
Default
 
which
 
makes
 
it
 
being
 
read
 
from
 
the
 
yaml
 
file.
 
While
 
"Segment_Default"
 
in
 
Advanced
 
MDX-NET23
 
settings
 
is
 
checked,
 
it
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
dim_t
 
value
 
from
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
config.
 
Simply
 
dim_t
 
is
 
the
 
segments.
 
Although
 
now
 
chunk_size
 
is
 
used
 
in
 
newer
 
patches
 
instead.
  -  “The  overlap  value  in  yaml  files  is  never  used  by  UVR,  only  the  value  in  GUI  is  used.”  “UVR  uses  inference.dim_t  from  config  as  segment_size,  but  the  inference.num_overlap  is  
not
 
used
 
by
 
UVR,
 
it's
 
always
 
using
 
the
 
value
 
in
 
the
 
GUI
 (while  ZFTurbo  original  script  is  using  audio.chunk_size  and  inference.num_overlap  but  not  
inference.dim_t
 
.
 
That's
 
a
 
mess)
