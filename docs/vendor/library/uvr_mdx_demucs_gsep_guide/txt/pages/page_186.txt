     -  Mel-Roformer  unwa’s  inst-voc  model  called  “duality  v1/2”  (focused  on  both  instrumental  
and
 
vocal
 
stem
 
during
 
training;
 
two
 
independent
 
and
 
not
 
inversible
 
stems
 
inside
 
one
 
weight
 
file).
 
 https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-InstVoc-Duality |  Colab |  MVSEP V1:  Inst  fullness  28.03,  bleedless  44.16,  SDR  16.69.   V2:  Inst  SDR  16.67  Outperformed  in  both  metrics  by  the  unwa’s  Kim  FT.  Vocals  sound  similar  to  beta  4  model,  instrumentals  are  deprived  of  the  noise  present  in  inst  
v1/e
 
models,
 
but
 
in
 
result,
 
they
 
don't
 
sound
 
similarly
 
muddy
 
to
 
previous
 
Roformers.
 Compared  to  beta  4  and  BS-Roformer  Large  or  other  archs’  models,  it  has  fewer  problems  
with
 
reverb
 
residues,
 
and
 
vs
 
v1e,
 
with
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
e.g.
 
Suno
 
AI
 
songs.
 "other"  is  output  from  model,  "Instrumental"  is  inverted  vocals  against  input  audio.  The  latter  has  lower  SDR  and  more  holes  in  the  spectrum,  using  MSST-GUI,  leave  the  
checkbox
 
“extract
 
instrumental”
 
disabled
 
for
 
duality
 
models
 
(now
 
it’s
 
also
 
in
 
the
 
Colab
 
with
 
“extract_instrumental”
 
option)
 
and
 
probably
 
for
 
inst
 
vx
 
models.
 You  can  use  it  in  the  Bas  Curtiz’  GUI for  ZFTurbo  script  or  with  the  OG  ZF’s  repo  code.   -  unwa’s  Mel-Roformer  fine-tuned  beta  3  (based  on  Kim’s  model)  https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-big/tree/main |  Colab Inst  SDR:  17.30  Since  beta  3  there’s  no  ringing  issues  in  higher  frequencies  like  in  previous  betas.

  -  unwa’s  Mel-Roformer  beta  4  (Kim’s  model  fine-tuned)  https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-big/tree/main |  Colab Outperformed  in  both  metrics  by  beta  5e.   Be  aware  that  the  yaml  config  is  different  in  this  model.  “Metrics  on  my  test  dataset  have  improved  over  beta3,  but  are  probably  not  accurate  due  to  
the
 
small
 
test
 
dataset.
 
(...)
 
The
 
high
 
frequencies
 
of
 
vocals
 
are
 
now
 
extracted
 
more
 
aggressively.
 
However,
 
leakage
 
may
 
have
 
increased.”

Can
 
be
 
a
 
better
 
choice
 
on
 
its

than
 
some
