    experience,  makes  the  model  underestimate  the  reverb.  [The  previous  anvuew’s  mono  
model]
 
is
 
way
 
different
 
[from]
 
this
 
one
 
in
 
every
 
way.
 
So,
 
like
 
I
 
say,
 
worth
 
a
 
shot.”

 Do  the  below  to  fix  stereo  error  using  that  model,  it  might  work  with  your  current  MSST  
version
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
linked
 
repo
 
too,
 
but
 
in
 
a
 
different
 
line.
