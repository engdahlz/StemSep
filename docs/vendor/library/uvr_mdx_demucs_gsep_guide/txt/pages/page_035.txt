    https://uvronline.app/ai?hp&test (premium)  https://uvronline.app/ai?test (free)”  -  Aufr33   “Oh!  Lead  vocal  panning  has  been  added  for  Mel  Kar  Old!  (...)  Along  with  MDX  Kar  old  and  UVR  Kar  old  to  the  test  page!!”  -  dca   -  Gabox  released  a  new  experimental  Karaoke  model.  It’s  one  stem  target  so  keep  extract_instrumental  enabled  for  the  rest  stem.  “really  hard  to  tell  the  difference  between  this  and  becruily's  karaoke  model”  minus  the  latter  
has
 
more
 
target
 
stems.
  -  jarredou  released  his  new  MDX23C  drumsep  5  stem  model,  which  is  public  for  everyone  to  download.  All  SDR  metrics  are  better  than  the  previous  model  (“on  kick/snare/toms  it's  around  +2  SDR  better  than  previous  version”):  SDR:  kick:  16.66,  snare:  11.54,  toms  12.34,  hihat:  4.04,  cymbals:  6.36  (all  metrics).  Metric  fullness  for  snare:  25.0361,  bleedless  for  hh:  12.3470,  log_wmse  for  snare:  13.8959  “Quite  cleaner  than  the  previous  one”,  “it's  more  on  the  fullness  side  than  bleedless”,   From  all  the  metrics,  only  bleedless  for  snare  is  worse  than  in  the  previous  model:   
26.8420
 
vs
 
30.4149
 
and
 
indeed
 
“snare
 
has
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
bleed
 
sometimes”
 
-
 
isling,
 
“as
 
well
 
as
 
cymbals
 
bleed
 
in
 
hi
 
hat
 
track,
 
but
 
the
 
stems
 
sound
 
clean”
 
-
 
dca.
 “a  lot  noisier  than  other  drumpsep  models,  but  that's  not  necessarily  a  bad  thing.”  “Surprisingly,  it's  the  2nd  best  model  for  hi  hat  and  2nd  best  model  for  cymbals  on  mvsep  
leaderboard.
 
It's
 
a
 
bit
 
biased
 
because
 
ZF's
 
top
 
mel
 
model
 
is
 
4
 
stem
 
only.”
 For  comparison,  metrics of  the  old  6  stem  jarredou/Aufr33  MDX23C  model   (which  has  cymbals  divided  into  ride  and  crash  which  are  not  evaluated):  SDR:  kick:  14.55,  snare:  9.79,  toms:  10.64,  hihat:  3.20,  cymbals:  6.08  Metric  fullness  for  snare:  25.0361,  bleedless  for  hh:  10.2765,  log_wmse  for  snare:  12.4258  The  model  was  trained  with  a  lightweight  config  to  train  on  a  subpar  T4  GPU  on  free  Colabs  
and
 
10
 
accounts
 
(“CRAAZY
 
fast”
 
for
 
inferencing).
 
The
 
metrics
 
do
 
not
 
surpass
 
exclusive
 
drumsep
 
Mel-Roformer
 
and
 
SCNet
 
models
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
but
 
at
 
least
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
one
 
locally.
 “Most  of  the  issues  with  my  model  are  already  known  issues  with  mdx23c  arch,  it's  bleedy  
and
 
has
 
band
 
splitting
 
artifacts.
 
Like
 
I
 
said
 
a
 
few
 
days
 
ago,
 
if
 
I
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
redo
 
it
 
now,
 
it
 
would
 
have
 
probably
 
gone
 
with
 
SCNet
 
Masked.
 
It's
 
using
 
4x
 
times
 
lower
 
n_fft
 
resolution
 
than
 
InstVocHQ
 
while
 
using
 
2
 
times
 
longer
 
chunk_size
 
(and
 
with
 
MDX23C,
 
whatever
 
number
 
of
 
stems,
 
it's
 
the
 
same
 
inference
 
speed).
 
A
 
bit
 
like
 
the
 
fruit’s
 
model
 
is
 
doing”.
 
Trained
 
on
 
511
 
tracks,
 
MVSEP
 
models
 
were
 
trained
 
on
 
almost
 
the
 
same
 
dataset.
 Maybe  if  we  separate  just  snare  with  the  old  MDX23C  model  from  an  already  separated  
drums
 
stem,
 
and
 
mix/invert
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
rest,
 
then
 
pass
 
it
 
through
 
the
 
new
 
model,
 
the
 
bleed
 
would
 
be
 
gone.
  Remember  that  you  need  already  separated  drums in  one  track  to  use  this  model  effectively.
