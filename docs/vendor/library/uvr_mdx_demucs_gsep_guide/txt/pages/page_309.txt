    song  by  its  official,  perfectly  inverting  instrumental,  then  it  may  not  get  the  best  result  by  the

there’s

result

 Based  on  9.7  NET  1  models,  MVSEP  synth  dataset  usually  gives  ~0.7  higher  scores  than  on  Demixing  Challange  2021  leaderboard.  Also,  it  favours  Bas  Curtiz  FT  model  more  than  multisong  dataset  due  to  some  characteristic  features  ZFTurbo  pointed  out.  “A  calculation  by  a  computer  isn't  a  human  ear”.   -  Another  way  to  at  least  sonically  evaluate  a  model/ensemble,  is  to  test  it  on  a  set  of  AI  killing  tracks which  tend  to  have  specific  issues  after  separation  with  most  if  not  all  models,  and  to  see  how  better  or  worse  it  got.  Childish  Gambino  –  Algorhythm  is  a  good  starting  
point
 
to
 
chase
 
differences
 
in
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
in
 
instrumentals
 
among
 
various
 
models,
 
due
 
to
 
specific
 
effects
 
applied
 
to
 
vocals.
  How  does  SDR  even  work  in  Python   def  sdr(reference,  estimate):      delta  =  1e-7   #  avoid  numerical  errors      num  =  np.sum(np.square(reference),  axis=(1,  2))      den  =  np.sum(np.square(reference  -  estimate),  axis=(1,  2))      num  +=  delta      den  +=  delta      return  10  *  np.log10(num  /  den)   Q:  Is  there  a  way  to  compare  SDR  between  an  official  instrumental  and  the  filtered  
instrumental
 
 A:  Bas  has  shared  an  .exe script  to  do  that  easily   (uvr-general  )   What  you  could  do,  but  only  if  u  have  the  original  vocal  or  instrumental,  is  to  check  on  SDR  
with
 
this:
  usage:  sdrcalc.exe  "c:\your-input-folder"  "c:\your-output-folder"   make  sure  they  have  the  exact  same  extension  +  filename    “Here  is  an  idea  for  multisong  leaderboard  V2,  with  the  songs  edited  to  have  the  loudness  of  
real
 
music.
