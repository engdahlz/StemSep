    Don’t  disable  invert_vocals  in  Colab  even  if  you  only  need  vocal  instead  of  instrumental,  
otherwise
 
the
 
Colab
 
will
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
error.
  MDX  noise  There  is  a  noise  using  all  MDX-UVR  inst/vocal  models,  and  it’s  model  dependent  (irc  4  
stems
 
don’t
 
have
 
it).
 
It's
 
fixed
 
in
 
Colabs
 
using
 
denoiser
 
"however
 
by
 
using
 
my
 
method,
 
conversions
 
will
 
be
 
2x
 
slower
 
as
 
it
 
needs
 
to
 
predict
 
twice.
 I  see  no  quality  degradation  at  all,  and  I  can't  believe  it  actually  worked  rofl"  -HV  Also,  UVR  5  GUI  has  the  same  noise  filtering  implemented  (if  not  better,  also  with  alternative  
model).
  Current  MDX  Colab  has  normalization  feature  “normalizes  all  input  at  first  and  then  changes  
the
 
wave
 
peak
 
back
 
to
 
original.
 
This
 
makes
 
the
 
separation
 
process
 
better,
 
also
 
less
 
noise.
 
IDK
 
if
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
tried
 
this,
 
but
 
if
 
you
 
split
 
a
 
quiet
 
track,
 
and
 
normalize
 
it
 
after
 
MDX
 
inference
 
the
 
noise
 
sounds
 
more
 
audible
 
than
 
normalizing
 
it
 
and
 
changing
 
the
 
peak
 
back
 
to
 
original.”
  If  you  want  to  experiment  with  MDX  sound,  the  Colab  from  before  that  change  is  below:  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EXlh--o34-rzAFNEKn8dAkqYqBvhVDsH?usp=sharing (might  no  longer  work  due  to  changes  made  by  Google  to  Colab  environment,  the  last  maintained  are  kae  and  HV  (new)  Colabs)   Furthermore,  you  can  also  try  manually  mixing  vocal  with  original  track  using  phase  
inversion
 
and
 
add
 
specific
 
gain
 
on
 
vocal
 
track
 
(+1.03597672895
 
or
 
+3.07)
 
for
 
9.7
 
model
 
(or
 
other
 
ones
 
with
 
different
 
values),
 
using
 
both
 
this
 
and
 
below
 
Colab
 
and
 
save
 
result
 
as
 
32
 
bit
 
float
 
(but
 
this
 
might
 
have
 
more
 
bleeding,
 
but
 
it
 
uses
 
32
 
bit
 
while
 
chunking):
 https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R32s9M50tn_TRUGIkfnjNPYdbUvQOcfh?usp=sharing#scrollTo=lkTLtOvyBuxc (for  e.g.  the  best  compensation  value  for  464  MDX-UVR  inst.  model  is  1.0568175092136585  and  it's  not  constant)   Also  be  aware  that  MVSEP  uses  32  bit  for  MDX-UVR  models  for  ready  inversion  of  any  
model
 
too.
  If  you  look  for  eliminating  the  noise  from  MDX-UVR  instrumentals,  also  the  method  
described
 
in
 
Zero
 
Shot
 
below
 
might
 
work.
  "I  just  run  the  MDX  vocals  thru  UVR  to  remove  any  remaining  buzz  noises  and  synths,  it  
works
 
great
 
so
 
far"
 
(probably
 
meant
 
one
 
of
 
VR
 
models)
  Average  track  in  Colab  is  being  processed  in  1:00-1:30  minute  using  slower  Tesla  K80  
(much
 
faster
 
than
 
even
 
UVR’s
 
HP-4BAND-V2_arch-124m
 
model).
