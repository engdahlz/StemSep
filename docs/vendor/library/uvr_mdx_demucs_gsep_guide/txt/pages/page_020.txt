    Demucs  model  doesn't  work  in  UVR,  as  it  was  trained  on  MSST,  and  not  the  OG  code  (I  tried  to  workaround  the  bag_num  issue  before,  and  failed)   -  (MVSEP)  “Two  new  instrumental  models  have  been  added:  MVSep  Harp  (harp,  other)  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250921131108-f0bb276157-mixture.wav MVSep  Double  Bass  (double-bass,  other)  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250921131129-f0bb276157-mixture.wav”  -  ZFTurbo  “The  BS-Roformer  SW  bass  model  should  probably  be  used  first  to  extract  the  double  bass.  
Creates
 
a
 
better
 
sound.
 
This
 
does
 
not
 
apply
 
to
 
bowed
 
double
 
bass.
 Bowed  double  bass  doesn't  get  picked  up  by  BS-Roformer  and  therefore  needs  the  double  
bass
 
model.
 
Good
 
news
 
is
 
that
 
bowed
 
double
 
bass
 
is
 
picked
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
strings
 
stem
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
the
 
strings
 
model
 
you're
 
good
 
either
 
way.”

  -  (MVSEP)  “A  new  saxophone  model  based  on  BSRoformer  was  added.  It  has  a  much  better  
metric
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
previous
 
[model].
 
SDR
 
grew
 
from
 
7.13
 
up
 
to
 
9.77.
 It's  available  in  "MVSep  Saxophone  (saxophone,  other)"  with  option  "BS  Roformer  (SDR  
saxophone:
 
9.77)
 Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250920151232-f0bb276157-mixture.wav”  -  ZFTurbo  “after  testing  this  on  a  song  where  trumpet  and  sax  play  in  unison,  doing  the  trumpet  model  
is
 
cleaner
 
than
 
doing
 
the
 
sax
 
model”

 “Amazing.  Tested  it  on  one  song,  it  got  every  single  Saxophone  Part  from  the  song  it  seems  
lit.
 
Can
 
hear
 
one
 
small
 
little
 
bitty
 
part
 
of
 
it
 
where
 
it
 
tries
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
off
 
the
 
Sax
 
part,
 
however
 
I
 
can
 
barely
 
hear
 
it”
