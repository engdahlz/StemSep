    others  described  in  the  models  list  section  at  the  top  can  be  more  aggressive  and  effective  
with
 
more
 
customizable
 
settings).
  3.  Unmix  drums   (mainly  tested  on  instrumentals)   Separate  an  input  song  using  4  stem  model,  then  mix  the  result  tracks  together  without  
drums
 
and
 
separate
 
the
 
result
 
using
 
strong
 
ensemble
 
or
 
single
 
vocal
 
or
 
instrumental
 
model
 
(doesn't
 
always
 
give
 
better
 
results).
 Alternatively,  unmix  bass  as  well.  There’s  great  bass+drums  BS-Roformer  model  released  
for
 
UVR
 
(currently
 
in
 
beta)
  4.  Pitch  it  down/up  (soprano/tenor  voice  trick  +  ensemble  of  both)   -  You  can  use  https://github.com/JoeAllTrades/SpectraDownshift for  it  (it’s  based  on  scipy,  it’s  lossless,  so  fully  reversible  and  nulls),  or:   -  Already  implemented  option  in  newer  versions  of  UVR  under  “Shift  Conversion  Pitch”  in

 And  there  are  positive  and  negative  values  when  you  scroll  up  and  down  
(lossy,
 
even
 
more
 
than
 
soxr).
  Negative  value  will  slow  down  the  track  before  separation,  so  e.g.  model  with  cut-off  will  be  
compensated
 
for
 
its
 
band
 
lost
 
a
 
bit
 
after
 
speeding
 
up
 
again.
 If  you  slow  down  the  input  file,  it  may  allow  you  to  separate  more  elements  in  the  “other”  
stem
 
of
 
4-6
 
stems
 
separations
 
of
 
Demucs
 
or
 
GSEP
 
(when
 
it’s
 
done
 
manually).
 It  works  either  when  you  need  an  improvement  in  such  instruments  like  snaps,  human  claps,  
etc.
 
The
 
soprano
 
feature
 
on
 
x-minus
 
works
 
similarly
 
(or
 
even
 
the
 
same),
 
it’s
 
also
 
good
 
for
 
high-pitched
 
vocals.
  Be  aware  that  low  deep  male  vocals  might  not  get  separated  while  using  this  method  (then  
use
 
tenor
 
voice
 
trick
 
instead
 
-
 
so
 
pitch
 
it
 
up
 
instead
 
of
 
pitching
 
it
 
down.
 Also,  it  serves  the  best  for  hard  paned  songs  (e.g.  1970  and  pre  era,  e.g.  The  Beatles,  etc).  
Also,
 
it
 
works
 
great
 
for
 
drums.
