 You  can  split  your  archive  into  parts  if  necessary.  It’s  perfect  to  use  in  Colab  notebooks.  Very  reliable  and  fast.

One
 
user
 
from
 
my

had
 
his

account
 
deleted
 
years
 
ago.
 
It
 
happened
 
after
 
a
 
few
 
file
 
takedowns
 
on
 
his
 
account
 
before.
 
That
 
time
 
he
 
uploaded
 
all
 
music
 
segments,
 
basically
 
assets
 
extracted
 
from
 
a
 
computer
 
game
 
publicly
 
on
 
a
 
forum,
 
and
 
shortly
 
later
 
he
 
was
 
banned.
 
It
 
wasn’t
 
even
 
arranged
 
and
 
ready
 
for
 
a
 
normal
 
release.
 
Probably
 
the
 
publisher
 
was
 
snitching
 
on
 
him
 
for
 
quite
 
some
 
time
 
already.
