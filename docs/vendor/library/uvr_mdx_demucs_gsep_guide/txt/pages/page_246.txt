 Becruily  Melband  guitar |  yaml (“Not  SOTA,  but  much  more  efficient  and  comparable  to  existing  guitar  models,  and  for  some  songs  it  might  work  better  because  it  picks  up  more

  Consider  using  Apollo  Universal  by  Lew  (model |  UVR |  Colab  in  HTMYOR)  to  get  more  clarity  after  separation.    Acoustic  guitar  -  dango.ai (paid,  probably  the  best  for  now,  better  in  at  least  some  songs  than  the  SW  model)  -  MVSep  Acoustic  Guitar  (strong  competitor,  outperforms  moises  “like  crazy”  -  uvronline.app  (viperx'  model  for  premium  users  -  does  a  good  job  too)  -  BS-Roformer  SW   -  Demucs  6s  -  sometimes,  when  it  picks  it  up  -  GSEP -  when  the  guitar  model  works  at  all  (it  usually  grabs  the  electric),  the  remaining  'other'  stem  often  is  a  great  way  to  hear  acoustic  guitar  layers  that  are  otherwise  hidden.".  -  lalal.ai (both  paid)>moises.ai (It  picks  up  acoustic  and  electric  guitar  together)
