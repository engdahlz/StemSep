  Unlimited  (till  their  server  space  is  full,  which  sadly  is  often  the  case,  files  get  deleted  after  6  days):  https://filebin.net/  2TB  (once  you  used  your  mobile  app)  Baidu  Pan  Users  outside  of  China  are  restricted  from  registering,  but  there  are  ways  to  circumvent  the  issue  with  Baidu  Cloud or  duspeaker.  Guides:  1 |  2 “I  don't  recommend  it,  unless  you  pay,  you're  stuck  with  150KB/s  downloads  maximum”  plus  “a  requirement  to  use  their  app  to  actually  download  (at  least  if  you  decide  to  share  your  
files)”
  100GB  (files  expire  after  21  days/50  downloads,  max  6GB  per  file)   https://filetransfer.io It  could  mess  up  with  filenames  after  downloading  from  direct  link  which  was  also  possible  
[at
 
least
 
in
 
the
 
past]
 
and
 
could
 
be
 
used
 
e.g.
 
in
 
Google
 
Colab,
 
there
 
was
 
some
 
sneaky
 
method
 
of
 
extracting
 
direct
 
links
 
clicking
 
on
 
download
 
buttons
 
instead
 
of
 
sharing
