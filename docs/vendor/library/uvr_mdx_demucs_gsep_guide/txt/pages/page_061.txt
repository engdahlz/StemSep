  If  you  have  Python  DLL  error  on  startup,  reinstall  the  last  beta  update  using  the  full  package  
instead,
 
then
 
the

from
 
the
 
newer
 
patch.
  “If  you  see  a  different  usage  of  VRAM  than  with  previous  Roformer  beta  version,  it  could  also  
be
 
because
 
the
 
new
 
beta
 
version
 
doesn't
 
rely
 
on
 
'inference.dim_t'
 
value
 
anymore
 
(if
 
you
 
were
 
using
 
edited
 
"dim_t"
 
value)
 You  have  to  edit  audio.chunk_size  now  (see  here  for  conversion  between  dim_t  and  chunk_size”  it’s  “In  model  yaml  config  file,  at  top  of  it,  chunk_size  is  first  parameter  (...)  you  
can
 
edit

files
 
directly
 
inside
 
UVR
 
now.”
  “Unfortunately,  SCnet  is  not  compatible  with  DirectML,  so  AMD  GPU  users  will  have  to  use  
the
 
CPU
 
for
 
those
 
models.
 Bandit  models  are  not  compatible  with  MPS  or  DirectML.  For  those  with  AMD  GPU's  and  
Apple
 
Silicon,
 
those
 
will
 
be
 
CPU
 
only.
 The  good  news  is  those  models  aren't  all  that  slow  on  CPU.”  -  Anjok
