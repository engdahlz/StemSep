    Don’t  download  in  OGG  from  Cobalt.  It’s  recompression  from  webm/Opus.  OGG  file  
is
 
not
 
on
 
variants
 
list
 
in
 
JDownloader
 
(and
 
probably
 
the
 
same
 
would
 
be
 
in
 
CML
 
tools
 
like
 
yt-dlp,
 
so
 
it’s
 
simply
 
not
 
on
 
YT).
 However,  it  will  have  some  additional  information  below  16kHz  compared  to  Opus  
downloaded
 
from
 
JDownloader,
 
probably
 
because
 
it
 
was
 
sourced
 
from
 
webm,
 
and
 
not
 
JDownloader's
 
Opus,
 
but
 
that’s
 
it.
 
Recompression
 
here
 
will
 
add
 
some
 
ringing
 issues  and  compression  artefacts.  Details  and  spectrograms  here.   Sometimes  it  happens  that  m4a  (AAC)  sounds  better  than  Opus.  It  all  depends  on  a  
track.
 
It
 
is
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
happen
 
if
 
both
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
cutoff
 
in
 
spectrogram
 
due
 
to
 
how
 
it
 
was
 
uploaded
 
on
 
YT.
   What  to  do  to  improve  the  audio  gathered  from  YT?   #1  Joining  frequencies  with  EQ  method    1)  Download  both  M4A  and  Opus  audio  from  YT  (if  Opus  is  available  for  your  video)   2)  Upsample  M4A  to  48kHz  (or  else  you  won’t  align  the  two  files  perfectly)  with  e.g.  
Resampler
 
(PPHS)
 
in
 
Ultra
 
mode
 
in
 
Foobar
 
1.3.20>Convert>...
 3)  To  have  frequencies  above  16kHz  from  Opus  and  better  sounding  frequencies  up  
to
 
16kHz
 
from
 
AAC,
 
we
 
will
 
combine
 
the
 
best
 
of
 
the
 
both
 
worlds
 
by:
 a)  applying  resonant  highpass on  Opus  file  at  15750Hz  in  e.g.  Ozone  8/9  EQ  b)  aligning  the  track  to  M4A  audio  file  (converted  to  48kHz  WAV  32),  so  added  as  
separate
 
track
 
in
 
free
 
DAWs
 
like
 
Audacity,
 
Cakewalk,
 
Ableton
 
Lite,
 
or
 
Pro
 
Tools
 
Intro
 
(or
 
eventually
 
Reaper
 
with
 
its
 
infinite
 
trial).
 Export  the  mixdown  as  WAV24.  It  should  be  more  than  enough.  Using  brickwall  highpass  instead  will  result  in  a  hole  in  frequency  in  the  result  
spectrogram
 
(check
 
it
 
in
 
Spek
 
afterwards,
 
and
 
also
 
whether
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
overlap
 
frequencies
 
in
 
the
 
crossover
 
-
 
consider
 
checking
 
also
 
linear
 
phase
 
in
 
e.g.
 
free
 
QRange
 
EQ).
              #2  Manual  ensemble  in  UVR   Files  ensemble  with  Max  Spec  in  UVR   Instead  of  EQ,  you  can  use  ensemble  after  manual  upsampling  of  M4A  file.  You  can  
have
 
your
 
files
 
aligned
 
in
 
UVR.
 Be  aware  that  this  method  is  not  fully  transparent,  and  produce  files  a  little  bit  
brighter,
 
and
 
still
 
with
 
cutoff,
 
but
 
not
 
brickwall
 
like
 
in
 
M4A.
  Without  upsampling  step,  you  can  use  Max  Spec  method  with  great  results  also  for  
Soundcloud
 
which
 
provides
 
64kbit/s
 
opus
 
and
 
128kbp/s
 
mp3
 
and
 
256kbp/s
 
aac.
 You  only  need  to  amplify  mp3  file  by  3dB.  Align  step  is  also  necessary  here,  but  it  
can
 
be
 
performed
 
in
 
UVR.
