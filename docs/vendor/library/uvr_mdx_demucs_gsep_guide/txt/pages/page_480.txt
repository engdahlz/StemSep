[page 480/642]
    So  I  converted  the  lossless  instrumentals  to  an  MP3  with  Foobar,  and  it  was  better,  but  still  
had
 
that
 
damned
 
drum
 
crackling!
 
So
 
i
 
kept
 
trying.
 
I
 
used
 
OPUS,
 
OGG,
 
different
 
bitrates
 
of
 
MP3,
 
even
 
AAC.
 
 I  have  found  that  OPUS  is  the  best  at  removing  the  drum  overlap,  I  cannot  hear  any  in  fact,  
with
 
OPUS.
  So,  my  final  guide  is,    If  you  are  getting  cracking/crackling/overlap  on  drum  hits  in  your  inversions,  then:   1.  Convert  the  instrumental  to  OPUS  (128  Kbps)  with  Foobar2000.   2.  Use  a  software  like  Audacity  to  amplify  it  to  a  peak  amplitude  zero  DB  (since  
apparently
 
OPUS
 
auto
 
declips
 
to
 
floating
 
levels?)
 
  3.  Export  it  as  a  WAV  at  the  original  sample  rate  (since  OPUS  only  supports  48  kHz,  I  
actually
 
tried
 
resampling
 
the
 
instrumental,
 
and
 
original
 
to
 
48
 
kHz
 
before
 
converting
 
to
 
OPUS,
 
but
 
found
 
that
 
results
 
in
 
a
 
WORST
 
output.)
 
  4.  Do  your  inversion  (hopefully  in  Utagoe)    5.  Use  whichever  vocal  model  you  like  the  output  for  best  for  cleanup.”  -  sausum   PS.  Once,  I've  runned  into  similar  issue.  And  I  fixed  it,  actually  similarly.  I  think  I  was  trying  to  
invert
 
with
 
mp3
 
VBR,
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
file
 
was
 
lossless,
 
so
 
I
 
converted
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
codec
 
and
 
bitrate/V
 
preset.
 Yes,  it  wasn't  perfect,  but  better.  I  wonder  if  simply  applying  cutoff  at  20kHz  wouldn't  be  a  better  solution.  That's  what  Opus  
more
 
or
 
less
 
does,
 
plus
 
upsampling
 
to
 
48kHz.
 
  -  Despite  the  fact  that  separation  is  in  32  bit  float,  align  inputs  option  in  UVR  uses  something  
lower
 
internally,
 
hence
 
the
 
clipping
 
may
 
occur.
  -  As  better  alternative  to  Utagoe  and  UVR’s  Align  feature,  you  can  use  paid  Auto  Align  Post  
2
 
(maybe
 
even
 
cheaper
 
MAutoAlign).
