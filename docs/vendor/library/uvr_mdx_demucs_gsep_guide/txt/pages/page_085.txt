     Even  epoch  5  trained  on  jarredou's  dataset  casually  in  free  Colab  (which  uses  Tesla  T4  
15GB
 
with
 
performance
 
of
 
RTX
 
3050,
 
but
 
with
 
more
 
VRAM)
 
with
 
multiple
 
Colab
 
accounts
 
and
 
very
 
light
 
and
 
fast
 
training
 
settings,
 
already
 
achieved
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
Drumsep:
  “epoch  5:   Instr  SDR  kick:  13.9763  Instr  SDR  snare:  8.4376  Instr  SDR  toms:  6.7399  Instr  SDR  hh:  0.7277  Instr  SDR  ride:  0.8014  Instr  SDR  crash:  4.4053  SDR  Avg:  5.8480   epoch  15:   Instr  SDR  kick:  15.3523  Instr  SDR  snare:  10.8604  Instr  SDR  toms:  10.3834  Instr  SDR  hh:  4.0184  Instr  SDR  ride:  2.7248  Instr  SDR  crash:  6.1663  SDR  Avg:  8.2509”   Don't  forget  to  use  already  well  separated  drums  (e.g.  from  Mel-Roformer  for  premium  users  
on
 
x-minus)
 
from
 
well
 
separated
 
instrumental
 
as
 
input
 
for
 
that
 
model,
 
or
 
Jarredou
 
MDX23
 
Colab
 
fork
 
v.
 
2.4
 
or
 
MVSEP
 
4/+
 
ensemble
 
(premium).
 Purely  for  drums  separation  from  even  instrumentals,  the  model  might  not  give  good  results.  
It
 
was
 
trained
 
just
 
on
 
percussion
 
sounds
 
and
 
not
 
vocals
 
or
 
anything
 
else.
  Also,  e.g.  the  kick  and  toms  might  have  a  bit  weird  looking  spectrograms.  It’s  due  to:  “mdx23c  subbands  splitting  +  unfinished  training,  these  artifacts  are  [normally]  reduced/removed  along  [further]  training.”  Examples  -  BTW,  just  for  inference  (separation),  “ONNX  and  Demucs  models  don't  work  with  
multi-GPU”
  -  In  the  “experimental”  section  of  MVSEP,  there’s  been  added  a  new  multispeaker  model  at  
the
 
bottom.
 E.g.  it  can  work  well  splitting  rapping  and  singing  overlapped  in  the  same,  previously  well  
separated
 
vocal
 
stem,
 
but:
 “It  works  more  or  less  ok  on  my  validation  [5  quite  different  "songs"],  but  it's  a  disaster  on  
real
 
data.
 
I
 
opened
 
it
 
for
 
everyone,
 
but
 
don't
 
expect
 
really
 
good
 
results”
