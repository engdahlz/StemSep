    -  Older  VR  model  by  HV  Colab  (Colab  fixed  16.02.24)  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WP5IjduTcc-RRsvfaFFIhnZadRhw-8ig?usp=sharing Don’t  forget  to  click  cell  with  dependencies  after  mounting   If  you  want  to  use  the  repo  locally,  use  just  this  fix  "If  you  have  two  language  track  it'll  remove  the  vocals,  but  not  its  adlibs"   "It  works  like  invert  but  instead  of  mixing  the  inverts  together,  it  removes  the  difference  and  
leaves
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
sound
 
the
 
same"
  It  uses  a  specifically  trained  model  on  100  pairs.   -  Sadly,  “It's  like  a  downgrade  of  Audacity  Vocal  and  Center  Isolation  feature”  -  it’s  
muddier
 Audacity  can  be  used  in  browser  at:  https://wavacity.com/  The  option  in  version  prior  3.5.0  is  located  in:  Effect>Special>Vocal  Reduction  and  isolation  on  2.x:  Effect>Vocal  Reduction  and  isolation  (at  the  very  bottom)  3.5.0  or  later:  downloadable  as  Nyquist  plugin  from  here   “Adobe  Audition  works  a  similar,  but  you  can  actually  tweak  a  lot  of  settings.  But  the  
difference
 
is
 
pretty
 
much
 
non-existent.
 
Or
 
any
 
better
 
for
 
that
 
matter.
 
Similar
 
way.
 
Even
 
with
 
Audacity,
 
Adobe
 
Audition,
 
and
 
PEEL
 
[3d
 
Audio
 
Visualize],
 
we
 
are
 
still
 
not
 
quite
 
there
 
yet.
 Currently,  Audacity,  and  maybe  Waves  Stereo  Center  plugin  have  the  best  capabilities,  but  
they
 
are
 
still
 
aren't
 
perfect.”

  Sadly,  it  turns  out  that  all  the  three  solutions  can  sound  worse  than  current  models  for  the  
use
 
case
 
of
 
getting
 
rid
 
of
 
dubbing
 
in
 
movies.
  It  can  be  used  with  window  size  768  on  CPU  as  well.  Probably  the  lowest  supported  for  GPU  
is
 
272
 
(352
 
was
 
set,
 
and
 
320
 
is
 
possible
 
too),
 
but
 
probably
 
it
 
won't
 
change
 
here
 
much.
  One  of  the  use  cases  of  Audacity  method  to  get  lead  vocals  (in  2021)  was  by  obtaining  e.g.  
main
 
vocals
 
from
 
vocal
 
or
 
BVE
 
model,
 
and
 
processing
 
that
 
stem
 
with
 
these
 
settings:
 Audacity>Effect>Vocal  reduction  and  isolation>  on  action,  make  it  Isolate  Center  Strength:  1.1  or  1.6  Then  click  OK.  That  effect  must  go  on  vocal  part.  If  you  use  center  isolation,  low/high  cut  will  
be
 
ignored
