     Instead  of  using  your  own  GPU  you  can  send  your  audio  file  to  Colab  and  use  smth  like  melroformer  v1e  with  default  settings.”  (introC)   Q:  What  difference  do  you  mean  with  "a  downmix  between  stereo  channels"  and  "a  single  
channel
 
from
 
source
 
stereo"?
 
It
 
seems
 
the
 
same
 
thing
 
to
 
me
 
but
 
I
 
may
 
be
 
missing
 
sth
 
obvious.
 A:  A  single  channel  is  either  left  or  right,  downmix  is  an  average  of  left  and  right  Q:  Then  I  guess  what  I  have  is  a  downmix?  A:  Not  sure,  you  need  to  check.  I  can  check  if  you  want,  sent  the  English  and  mono  audio.  
But
 
basically,
 
align
 
the
 
tracks,
 
downmix
 
the
 
English
 
track
 
and
 
check
 
for
 
null
 
when
 
mixing
 
with
 
the
 
French
 
mono
 
track.
 
If
 
it
 
isn't
 
null,
 
then
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
downmix
 
(or
 
the
 
audio
 
tracks
 
have
 
other
 
differences)
   _____  OG VR  broken  Colab  by  HV  fixing  history  It  was  fixed  by  adding  these  lines  to  it:    !apt-get  install  python3.8  !apt-get  install  python3.8-distutils  !apt-get  install  python3.8  pip  !python3.8  -m  pip  install  librosa==0.9.1  !python3.8  -m  pip  install  numpy==1.19.5  !python3.8  -m  pip  install  numba==0.55.0  !python3.8  -m  pip  install  tqdm  !python3.8  -m  pip  install  torch==1.13.1   and  renamed  inference  Colab  line  to  python3.8   (not  necessary)  !  pip  install  soundfile=0.11.0   distutils  was  necessary  to  fix  numpy  wheel  error,  but  regular  3.8  installed  before  was  
necessary
 
for
 
Colab
 
to
 
recognize
 
!python3.8
 
commands.
 
Because
 
3.8
 
was
 
bare,
 
it
 
needed
 
pip
 
installed
 
separately
 
for
 
this
 
3.8
 
installation.
 
Then
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
necessary
 
packages
 
are
 
installed
 
for
 
3.8
 
-
 
the
 
old
 
librosa
 
fix,
 
numpy
 
for
 
3.8,
 
and
 
broken
 
dependencies
 
numba
 
and
 
tqdm.
 
Then,
 
the
 
last
 
torch
 
working
 
in
 
HV
 
Colabs
 
was
 
1.13.1,
 
1.4
 
didn't
 
work
 
though
 
it's
 
compatible
 
with
 
3.8.
 
Maybe
 
CUDA
 
or
 
generally
 
upgraded
 
Ubuntu
 
problem.
 
Can't
 
tell.
 
It
 
was
 
necessary
 
anyway
 
because
 
Torch
 
wasn't
 
installed
 
for
 
3.8.
  Additionally,  to  fix  the  regular  VR  Colab,  this  line  was  necessary:  !python3.8  -m  pip  install  opencv-python
