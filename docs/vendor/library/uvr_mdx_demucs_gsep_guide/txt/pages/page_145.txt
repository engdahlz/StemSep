     -  New  public  dataset  published  by  Moises  (MoisesDB).  There  are  some  problems  with  downloading  it  now,  and  it’s  82,7GB  and  link  expires  during  downloading  after  600  seconds.  
Not
 
enough
 
for
 
30MB/s,
 
but
 
good
 
for
 
10Gbps
 
one.
 
Moises
 
team
 
works
 
on
 
the
 
issue.
 
Probably
 
it's
 
fixed
 
already.
  -  RipX  inside  the  app  uses  UVR  for  gathering  stems  now.  Consider  also  comparing  its  stem  
cleanup
 
feature
 
to
 
RX
 
10
 
debleed
 
in
 
RX
 
Editor.
 -  “RipX  is  badass  for  removing  residues  and  harmonics  from  vocals.  The  ability  to  remove  
harmonics
 
&
 
BGVs
 
using
 
RipX
 
is
 
amazing
 
but
 
is
 
very
 
tedious
 
but
 
so
 
far
 
so
 
good”

  -  Sometimes  using  vocal  model  like  voc_ft  on  the  result  from  instrumental  model  might  give  
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
or
 
sometimes
 
even
 
none

  -  mvsep1.ru  from  now  on,  contains  a  content  of  mvsep.com,  so  without  MDX23/C  and  login  
features,
 
while
 
mvsep.com
 
has
 
the
 
richer
 
content
 
of
 
mvsep1.ru
 The  old  leaderboard  link  has  changed  and  is  now:  https://mvsep1.ru/quality_checker/leaderboard2.php?sort=instrum -  old  domain  is  also  fixed  now,  redirecting  leaderboard  links.  If  you’re  uploading  in  quality  checker  is  stopped,  clear  your  browser  and  start  over.   -  Dereverb  and  denoiser  for  VR  arch  is  not  compatible  with  any  VR  Colab  and  manual  installation  of  such  model  will  fail  with  errors.  It  requires  modifying  nets  and  layers.  More  -  New  best  ensemble  (all  Avg/Avg)   (read  entries  details  on  the  chart for  settings  -  they  can  have  very  time-consuming  parameters  and  differ  in  that  aspect)  #1  MDX23C_D1581  +  Voc  FT  |  #2  MDX23C_D1581  +  Inst  HQ3  +  Voc  FT   |  #3  MDX23C_D1581  +  Inst  HQ3  +  Voc  FT   Be  aware  that  above  can  sound  noisy/have  vocal  leaks  at  times;  consider  using  HQ_3  or  kim  
inst
 
then,
 
also:
 
  -  The  best  ensembles  so  far  in  Kashi's  testing  for  general  use:  Kim  Vocal  2  +  Kim  FT  other  +  Inst  Main  +  406  +  427  +  htdemucs_ft  avg/avg,  or:  Voc  FT,  inst  HQ3,  and  Kim  FT  other  (kim  inst)  “This  one's  much  faster  than  the  first  ensemble  and  sometimes  produces  better  results”   It  all  depends  on  a  song.  Also,  sometimes  "running  one  model  after  another  in  the  right  order  
can
 
yield
 
much
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
ensembling
 
them".
  -  Disable  "stem  combining"  for  vocal  inverted  against  the  source.  Might  be  less  muddy,  
possibly
 
better
 
SDR.
