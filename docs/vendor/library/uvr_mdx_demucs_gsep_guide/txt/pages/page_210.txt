    The  list  by  Musicalman  (mostly  from  before  the  Gabox  models  release,  check  vocals too)  “Any  vocal  model  in  the  past  few  years  should  work  for  speech  separation.  My  favorites  at  
the
 
moment
 
are:
 -  MDX23c  Inst-Voc  HQ   -  other  similar  MDX  models  for  least  aggressive,  but  bleedy,  only  really  useful  for  denoising   -  Unwa's  Mel-Roformer  big  beta  4  or  beta  5e  vocal  models  -  for  less  bleed.  Atm,  5e  is  my  
go-to
 
as
 
it
 
sounds
 
less
 
filtered.
 ~  I've  heard  people  praise  BS-Roformers  a  lot,  haven't  really  tested  those  much,  though.  -  Becruily's  vocal  model  can  also  be  better  at  SFX  separation,  but  can  overestimate  reverb  in  
vocal
 
stem
 
sometimes.
 -  Mel-Roformer  Karaoke  by  viperx  and  aufr33  -  for  more  aggressive  separation  (removes  a  
bit
 
more
 
SFX)
 -  And  the  most  aggressive  are  Bandit  models  and  the  DNR  v3  models  on  MVSEP,  though  
they
 
tend
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
too
 
aggressive
 
for
 
my
 
taste,
 
so
 
I
 
only
 
use
 
them
 
selectively.
 This  is  just  my  own  opinions  though,  subject  to  change  at  a  moment's  notice  lol”   [you’ll  find  them  in  SFX  section]  -  clearvoice -  it's  a  set  of  speech  enhancement/separation  models.  My  favorite  model  of  the  set  is  MossFormer2_SE_48K.  Its  dialog  extraction  seems  to  be  similar  to  Bandit  v2,  though  
clearervoice
 
sounds
 
fuller
 
to
 
me,
 
and
 
separation
 
is
 
usually
 
a
 
bit
 
better.
 
Might
 
be
 
especially
 
good
 
in
 
an
 
ensemble
 
with
 
Bandit
 
or
 
vocal
 
sep
 
models
 
eg.
 
unwa,
 
gabox
 
etc.
 -  BS-Roformer  2025.06  on  MVSEP  -  “handle  speech  very  well.  Most  models  get  confused  by  
stuff
 
like
 
birds
 
chirping
 
(they
 
put
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem),
 
but
 
this
 
model
 
keeps
 
them
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem
 
way
 
more
 
than
 
most.
 
I
 
love
 
it!”
  See  also:  -  various  speakers  isolation  -  harmonies -  two  singers  isolation  -  karaoke    Can’t  find  a  model?   -  Results  containing  models  in  e.g.  #946 (e.g.  406,  427,  438)  or  other  ensembles  mentioned  above,  still  have  public  models  available  in  UVR,  but  you  can  access  them  by  entering  the  download/vip  code in  UVR,  so  more  models  will  show  up   You  cannot  use  VIP  code  on  older  beta  UVR  Roformer  patches  (updates),  then  to  use  any  other  VIP  model  with  Roformers  (e.g.  D1581),  you  need  to  install  the  stable  5.6  from  official  
GH
 
repo,
 
download
 
the
 
model,
 
and
 
update
 
the
 
installation
 
with
 
the
 
old
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
afterwards
 
if
 
you
 
need
 
such
 
version
