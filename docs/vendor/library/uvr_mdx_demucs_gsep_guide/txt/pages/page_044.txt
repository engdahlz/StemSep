  “Important  note:  This  is  not  a  duet  or  male/female  model.  If  2  singers  are  singing  
simultaneously
 
+
 
background
 
vocals,
 
it
 
will
 
count
 
both
 
singers
 
as
 
lead
 
vocals.
 
The
 
model
 
strictly
 
keeps
 
only
 
actual
 
background
 
vocals.
 
The
 
same
 
goes
 
for
 
"adlibs"
 
such
 
as
 
high
 
notes
 
or
 
other
 
overlapping
 
lead
 
vocals.
 The  model  is  not  foolproof.  Some  songs  might  not  sound  that  much  improved  compared  to  
others.
 
It's
 
very
 
hard
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
dataset
 
for
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
task.
  Tip:  For  even  better  results,  first  extract  the  vocals  with  a  fullness  model  (like  mine)  and  
combine
 
the
 
results
 
with
 
a
 
fullness
 
instrumental
 
model.”
 
becruily
  The  model  outputs  2  stems  like  duality  models,  so  you  might  end  up  with  three  outputs  if  you  
check
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
invert
 
stem
 
-
 
don’t
 
use
 
it,
 
it
 
will
 
rather
 
have
 
worse
 
quality
 
than
 
what
 
the
 
model
 
outputs.
  -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  2  more  models  for  DrumSep  based  on  MelBand  Roformer  architecture.”   a)  4  stems  (kick,  snare,  toms,  cymbals)  -  average  SDR of  hihat  ride,  crash  is  11,52  (but  in  one  stem)  and  so  far  it’s  the  best  SDR  out  of  all  models  (even  vs  the  previous  ensemble  
consisting
 
of
 
three
 
MDX23C
 
and
 
SCNet
 
models).
 
 b)  6  stems  (kick,  snare,  toms,  hihat,  ride,  crash)  -  average  SDR  of  hihat  ride,  crash  is  8.18  
(but
 
from
 
separated
 
stems),
 
while
 
 The  snare  in  a)  has  the  best  SDR  out  of  all  available  models.  
Kick
 
and
 
toms
 
are
 
still
 
the
 
best
 
SDR-wise
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
3x
 
MDX23C
 
and
 
SCNet
 
ensemble
 
(new
 
ensemble
 
with
 
these
 
new
 
Mel-Roformers
 
so
 
far)
 -  The  new  models  “are  very  great  for  ride/crash/hh.  And  overall  they  have  the  best  metrics  
almost
 
for
 
all
 
stems.”

ZFTurbo
  -  Aname  released  two  4  stems  Mel-Roformer  models:  https://huggingface.co/Aname-Tommy/melbandroformer4stems/tree/main a)  Large  (4GB)  SDR  drums:  9.72,  bass:  9.40,  other:  5.11,  vocals  8.65  (multisong  dataset)  b)  XL  (7GB)  SDR  drums:  9.83,  bass:  9.37,  other:  5.31,  vocals  8.57  (multisong  dataset)  The  latter  doesn’t  work  in  the  custom  model  import  Colab  with  at  least  the  default  
chunk_size,
 
and
 
works
 
slow
 
on
 
e.g.
 
3060
 
(?12GB).
 
Both
 
models
 
were
 
trained
 
with
 
chunks
 
set
 
to
 
15
 
seconds
 
(chunk_size
 
=
 
661500).
 “I  tried  a  song  on  4070  Super  it  took  like  6  mins  on  XL  4  stems  compared  to  30  seconds  on  
Large
 
4
 
stems”
 
On
 
3060
 
XL
 
is
 
very
 
slow.
 Despite  lower  AVG  SDR  on  musdb18  dataset  vs  demucs_ft  (8.54  vs  9),  it  seems  to  
outperform
 
that
 
model
 
(SDR
 
is
 
only
 
better
 
in
 
other
 
stem),
 
public
 
SCNet,
 
SCNetXL,
 BS-Roformer  have  better  metrics (still  musdb18  dataset,  not  multisong  on  MVSEP)  “Drums  are  sounding  really  good  in  particular,  tested  a  couple  songs  with  the  large  model  
after
 
using
 
unwa's
 
v1e+
 
for
 
instrumental”
 
“drums
 
are
 
absolutely
 
the
 
standout“
 “Large  works  in  like  99%  use  case”  “Large  split  sounds  amazing  so  far  tho”
