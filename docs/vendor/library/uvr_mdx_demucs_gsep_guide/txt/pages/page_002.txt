 “deux  just  seems  to  make  some  things  super  muddy  and/or  break  them  up...  like  an  
instrument
 
here
 
is
 
just
 
really
 
wobbly
 
with
 
deux,
 
probably
 
because
 
it
 
doesn't

the

required.
 hyperace  sounds  better  in  areas  here,  but  noisy  in  others..  I  guess  you  really  gotta  use  all  3  
models

you

a
 
great
 
result”
 “Love  the  new  model,  besides  it  being  on  par  with  v1e  in  terms  of  fullness  (on  some  tracks  
it's
 
even
 
fuller)
 
without
 
the
 
noise
 
tradeoff,
 
it's
 
also

better
