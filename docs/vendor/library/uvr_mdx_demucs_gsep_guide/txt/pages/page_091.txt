     The  old  files  from  previous  separations  on  your  account  didn't  get  deleted  so  far.   -  (x-minus)  max_mag  of  (?-)Roformer  and  Demucs  (drums  only)  added    “now  the  synths  and  everything  else  feels  muddy  noticed  the  drums  in  some  places  (mainly  louder-ish  bits)  sound  a  bit  weird  mostly  lower  end  like  bass  drum  instead  of  hi  hats  great  improvement  overall”  isling   -  Doubledouble  might  have  some  occasional  hiccups  on  downloading.  If  you  encounter  very  
slow
 
download,
 
don’t
 
attempt
 
retrying
 
the
 
same
 
download,
 
but
 
generate
 
a
 
new
 
download
 
query.
 
Do
 
it
 
even
 
three
 
times
 
in
 
a
 
row
 
if
 
necessary
 
or
 
wait
 
half
 
an
 
hour
 
and
 
retry.
 
Also,
 
you
 
can
 
check
 
the
 
option
 
to

hosting.
  -  (x-minus)  “Added  max_mag  ensemble  for  Mel-RoFormer  model!  It  combines  Mel  and  BS  
results,
 
making
 
the
 
instrumentals
 
even
 
less
 
muddy,
 
while
 
better
 
preserving
 
saxophone
 
and
 
other
 
instruments.”
  -  New  Mel-Roformer  model  trained  by  Kimberley  Jensen  on  Aufr33  dataset  dropped  exclusively  on  x-minus.  “This  model  will  now  be  used  by  default  and  in  ensemble  with  MDX23C  (avg).”  It’s  less  muddy  than  viperx  model,  but  can  have  more  vocal  residues  e.g.  in  silent  parts  of  
instrumentals,
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
more
 
problematic
 
with
 
wind
 
instruments
 
putting
 
them
 
in
 
vocals,
 
plus
 
it
 
might
 
leave
 
more
 
instrumental
 
residues
 
in
 
vocals.
 
 “godsend  for  voice  modulated  in  synth/electronic  songs”  SDR  is  higher  than  viperx  model  (UVR/MVSEP)  but  lower  than  fine-tuned  04.24  model  on  
MVSEP.
  -  New  UVR  patch  has  been  released.  It  fixes  using  OpenCL  on  AMD  and  Intel  GPUs  (just  
make
 
sure
 
you
 
have
 
GPU
 
processing
 
turned
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
main
 
window
 
and
 
(perhaps
 
only
 
in
 
some
 
cases)
 
OpenCL
 
turned
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
settings).
 Plus,  it  fixes  errors  when  the  notification  chimey  in  options  is  turned  on.   https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/uvr_update_patches/UVR_Patch_4_14_24_18_7_BETA_full_Roformer.exe (be  aware  that  you  can  lose  your  current  UVR  settings  after  the  update)  To  use  BS-Roformer  models,  go  to  download  center  and  download  them  in  MDX-Net  menu  
(probably
 
temp
 
solution).
 For  4GB  VRAM  and  at  least  AMD/Intel  GPUs,  you  can  try  out  segments  32,  overlap  2  and  dim_t  201  with  num_o  2  (dim_t  is  at  the  bottom  of  e.g.  
model_bs_roformer_ep_368_sdr_12.9628.yaml)
 
to
 
avoid
 
crashes.
