Anjok’s  interview  on  YT   TL;DW:  UVR’s  documentary  +  training,  archs  and  demudder  explained   Anjok  is  the  developer  of  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover  5  (UVR5  GUI).  He  intended  UVR  to  be  a  Swiss  army  tool  -  to  contain  everything  you  need  for  separation,  
and
 
also
 
contain
 
models
 
made
 
by
 
the
 
community
 
(e.g.
 
dereverb/denoise/deecho).
  History  of  UVR   Anjok  in  times  where  Spleeter  was  still  a  thing,  found  a  VR  arch  made  by  Japanese  
developer,
 
tsurumeso,
 
and
 
received
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
Spleeter.
 
He
 
started
 
to
 
make
 
his
 
own
 
model
 
on
 
laptop
 
1060
 
6GB
 
on
 
100
 
or
 
150
 
pairs
 
with
 
the
 
absolute
 
minium
 
parameters,
 
and
 
it
 
turned
 
out
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
better
 
model
 
than
 
tsurumeso's
 
one.
 
Later
 
he
 
transitioned
 
to
 
faster
 
GPU
 
(probably
 
before
 
3090
 
yet).
 Anjok  wanted  GUI  for  VR,  and  found  BoskanDilan  on  Fiver  and  simply  contracted  him,  
paying
 
to
 
build
 
the
 
foundations
 
of
 
what
 
UVR
 
is
 
today.
 
BoskanDilan
 
turned
 
out
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
and
 
talented
 
coder.
 They  put  the  work  on  GitHub,  and  Aufr33  contacted  Anjok  with  ideas  on  how  the  VR  models  
can
 
be
 
improved
 
etc.
  Then  BoskanDilan  left  in  mid  2021  for  personal  reasons.  Then  the  GUI  work  was  taken  by  
Anjok
 
who
 
was
 
mentored
 
by
 
BoskanDilan
 
to
 
improve
 
on
 
understanding
 
the
 
coding.
 
Anjok
 
started
 
to
 
working
 
on
 
UVR
 
exclusively,
 
spending
 
10
 
hours
 
a
 
day
 
for
 
UVR
 
in
 
2022.
 
 He  decided  to  make  a  simple  installer  in  one  package,  as  he  received  lots  of  issues  on  
GutHub,
 
from
 
people
 
not
 
knowing
 
how
 
to
 
install
 
it.
 
He
 
also
 
re-coded
 
the
 
UVR
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
code
 
easier
 
to
 
maintain.
 
Then
 
Bas
 
Curtiz
 
helped
 
Anjok
 
on
 
design
 
aspects
 
of
 
UVR,
 
e.g.
 
designed
 
new
 
logo,
 
and
 
gave
 
some
 
advice,
 
and
 
good
 
amount
 
of
 
feedback
 
from
 
UVR
 
user
 
perspective.
 
Early
 
2022
 
phase
 
of
 
UVR
 
development
 
took
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
advice
 
from
 
early
 
users
 
of
 
UVR.
 In  May  2022  there  was  a  first  installer  released  to  make  UVR  more  accessible  without  e.g.  
installing
 
Python
 
or
 
other
 
dependencies
 
and
 
specialized
 
programming
 
knowledge
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
proper
 
environment.
  Anjok  was  still  in  charge  of  introducing  other  archs  than  VR  into  UVR,  being  simply  the  only  
one
 
behind
 
the
 
process,
 
while
 
normally
 
bigger
 
teams
 
work
 
on
 
projects
 
of
 
that
 
scale,
