    At  least  it  was  the  best  for  the  given  date.  But  now  we  have  ensembles  which  score  better.]   -  Kim  vocal  1  is  best  for  Rock  -  Kim  vocal  1  &  Ensemble  Rating  1  are  best  for  RnB/Latin/Soul/Funk   -  MDX'23  Best  Model  is  best  for  Pop  -  Main  427  &  MDX'23  Best  Model  are  best  for  Other  -  Main  427  &  MDX'23  Best  Model  are  best  for  Blues/Country   -  Main  427  &  Ensemble  Rating  1  are  best  for  Jazz  -  Main  427  &  Ensemble  Rating  1  are  best  for  Acoustic  genres   -  Ensemble  Rating  1  is  best  for  Beats  -  Ensemble  Rating  1  is  best  for  Hip  Hop  -  Ensemble  Rating  1  is  best  for  House   Sheet  where  **Kim  vocal  2  **is  removed:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceXA7XKmECwnsQvs7a0S81XZOUokIXUN8ndsUDcYRcc/edit?usp=sharing"   Further  single  MDX-UVR  models  descriptions  E.g.  used  for  ensembles  above,  but  if  a  model  has  a  cutoff,  using  ensemble  with  models/AIs  
without

like
 
Demucs
 
2-4
 
will
 
fill
 
the

  UVR-MDX  models  naming  scheme   All  models  called  "main"  are  vocal  models.  All  models  called  "inst"  and  "inst  main"  are  instrumentals.  NET-X  [9.X/9.XXX  in  Colab]  are  vocal  models  Kim  vocal  1/2  (self-explanatory)  Inst  main  is  496  Kim  other  ft  is  Kim  inst  Model  labelled  as  just  ‘main’  is  vocal,  and  was  reported  to  have  the  same  checksums  as  427  
and
 
423,
 
but
 
it
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
to

main

different

has
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
main,
 
so
 
apparently
 
main
 
is

  -  MDX  HQ_1/2  models  -  excellent,  vivid  snares,  no  cutoff  (22kHz)  high  quality,  rarely  worse

  -  MDX-UVR  Inst  3  model  (464)  -  17.7  cutoff  (the  same  cutoff  as  for  Inst  1,  2  inst  main,  but  
maybe
