     At  least  for  MDX23C  models  it  happened  for  someone,  that  every  separation  made  in  UVR  
differed
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
muddiness
 
and
 
residues,
 
and
 
someone
 
received
 
satisfactory
 
result
 
after
 
the
 
second
 
or
 
third
 
attempt
 
of
 
separating
 
the
 
same
 
song.
 
Consider
 
turning
 
on
 
Test
 
mode
 
in
 
UVR,
 
so
 
the
 
few
 
digits
 
number
 
will
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
output
 
file
 
name,
 
so
 
the
 
results
 
won’t
 
be
 
overwritten
 
during
 
the
 
process,
 
and
 
you’ll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
listen
 
and
 
compare
 
them.
  45.  Ensemble  instrumental  result  with  drums  with  max/max   Can  help  to  fix  muddiness  of  vocal  BS-Roformer  models,  but  drums  can  sound  too  loud  in  
the
 
end.
 
Consider
 
decreasing
 
their
 
volume
 
before
 
ensemble
 
if
 
necessary.
 Drums  can  be  obtained  from  e.g.  demucs_ft  (and  mixture  as  input  or  from  some  less  muddy  
model)
 
or
 
from
 
MDX23
 
Colab/MVSEP
 
(which
 
already
 
uses
 
its
 
own
 
input
 
from
 
model
 
ensemble
 
for
 
4
 
stems)
  46.  Use  EQ  on  your  song  before  separation  (e.g.  for  too  weak  “s”  sounds  in  separated  
vocals)
  It’s  an  old  method  used  in  times  when  models  didn’t  give  good  quality  yet,  might  be  no  
longer
 
necessary.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
EQ
 
on
 
a
 
mixture
 
to
 
stress
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
mix
 
more,
 
so
 
the
 
separation
 
might
 
turn
 
out
 
to
 
be
 
better.
  47.  Bas  Curtiz  video tutorial  for  tips  and  tricks  and  document  48.  Aufr33’s  demudder (more  for  Roformers  than  HQ  4)   49.  Volume  compensation  finetuning  for  MDX-Net  models   It  can  slightly  enhance  the  result,  helping  fighting  muddiness  a  bit.  It’s  no  longer  beneficial  for  MDX23C  and  Roformer  models.   Volume  compensation  generally  differ  for  every  song.  E.g.  for  HQ_3  model,  sometimes  
1.035
 
can
 
be
 
the
 
best,
 
but
 
sometimes
 
1.022.
 
By
 
default,
 
it
 
affects
 
only
 
vocals,
 
but
 
when
 
you
 
switch
 
primary
 
stem
 
in
 
model
 
settings,
 
so
 
vocals
 
are
 
labelled
 
as
 
instrumentals
 
and
 
vice
 
versa
 
(so
 
how
 
MDX
 
kae
 
Colab
 
works),
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
also
 
to
 
fine
 
tune
 
instrumental
 
stems.
  50.  Picking  correct  models  for  ensemble  (by  dca100fb8)   “I'm  seeing  a  certain  pattern,  if  the  Mel-Roformer  model  from  x  minus  leaves  faint  vocals  in  
the
 
background
 
during
 
silent
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
song,
 
then
 
it
 
means
 
MDX23
 
&
 
Demucs
 
4
 
htdemucs_ft
 
models
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
ensemble
 
because
 
vocals
 
can
 
be
 
heard
 
in
 
the
 
background
 
too
 
using
 
these
 
models,
 
while
 
MDXv2
 
models
 
will
 
not
 
leave
 
those
 
vocals.
 
So
 
it's
 
either
 
UVR
 
Mel/BS-Roformer
 
1296
 
+
 
1297
 
+
 
MDXv2
 
or
 
MDX23
 
+
 
Demucs
 
+
 
Mel-Roformer
 
X
 
Minus
 
+
 
BS-Roformer
 
1296
 
+
 
1297.
