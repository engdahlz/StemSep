 “it  is  probably  the  highest  SDR  or  log  wmse  score  in  my  model  to  date.”  “There's  some  noise  audible;  it  doesn't  sound  as  clean  when  you  compare  to  a  more

it's
 
certainly
 
not

I
 
think
 
calling

wouldn't
 
be
 
crazy...

“Significantly
 
better”
 
than
 
5e
 
for
 
some
 
people,
 
although
 
slower.
 
Some
 
leaks
 
into
 
vocal
 
might
 
occur,
 
plus
 
“The
 
biggest
 
problem
 
with
 
the
 
model
 
is
 
the
 
remaining
 
background
 
noise.
 
If
 
it
 
were
 
cleaner,
 
it
 
would
 
already
 
be
 
an
 
almost
 
perfect
 
result.”

 “6X  has  a  lot  less  noise  on  vocals,  but  it's  pretty  muddy.  I  would  prefer  something  in  between  
[5e
 
and
 
6X].
 
I
 
tried
 
to
 
apply
 
the
 
phase
 
[fixer/swapper]
 
to
 
the
 
vocals
 
and
 
the
 
noise
 
was
 
reduced,
 
but
 
only
 
slightly.”

 Some  people  might  prefer  fv5  instead  [at  least  on  some  songs]  ~5b  “6x  is  picking  up  BV  just  fine,  where  voc  fv4  is  failing”  -  Rainboom  Dash  Training  details:  “dim  512,  depth  12.  It  is  the  largest  Mel-Band  Roformer  model  I  have  ever  uploaded.”  -  “the

the
 
board

for
 
the

 “i  feel  like  most  songs  hyperace  gets  a  good  bleedless  result  but  ill  probably  stick  w  voc  fv7

 “it  seems  to  be  like..  trying  really  hard  to  pull  certain  stuff  out  that  is  causing  noise,  I  think  it  doesn't  sound  that  bleedless  to  me,  due  to  that  reason  (..)  there's  some  noise  during  some  
quieter
 
parts
 
but
 
I'll
 
def
 
be
 
adding
 
this
 
to
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
models
 
I
 
use.
 
I
 
was
 
testing
 
against
 
fv7beta2,
 
during
 
louder
 
parts
 
there
 
seemed
 
to
 
be
 
less
 
noise,
 
but
 
during
 
quieter
 
parts
 
there
 
seemed
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
noise
 
(...)
 I'll  prob  use  fv7beta2  for  the  most  part  still,  but  I'll  try  adding  hyperace  vocal  model  to  the  mix  
of
 
models
 
I
 
use.
 
lol,
 
soon
 
I'll
 
be
 
using
 
10
 
models
 
throughout
 
one
 
song”

  Note:  It  also  uses  its  own  inference  script  (bs_roformer.py)  and  different  from  the  previous  
one,
 
and
 
it’s
 
also
 
incompatible
 
with
 
UVR.
 
“You
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
model
 
by
 
replacing
 
the
 
MSST
 
repository's
 
models/bs_roformer.py
 
with
 
the
 
repository's
 
bs_roformer.py.”
 To  not  affect  functionality  of  other  BS-Roformer  models  by  that  file,  so  older  BS-Roformers  
will
 
still
 
work,
 
you
 
can
 
add
 
it
 
as
 
new
 
model_type
 
by
 
editing
 
utils/settings.py
 
and
 models/bs_roformer/init.py  here (thx  anvuew).  For  error  while  installing  the  py  file  for  HyperACE  model  in  Sucial’s  WebUI:  from  models.bs_roformer.attend  import  Attend  ModuleNotFoundError:  No  module  named  'models'"
