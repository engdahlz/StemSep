    “I've  only  removed  the  denoise  double  pass  for  demucs_6s,  it's  activated  for  other  demucs  
models.”
  jarredou:  “you  can  use  a  workaround  to  have  MDX23C  InstVoc-HQ  results  only  with  (dead)  settings:  (all  weights  beside  MDXv3  set  to  0,  BigShifts_MDX  set  to  min.  of  1,  and  demucs  overlap  0  
[at
 
least
 
for
 
vocal_instru_only)
 You  can  use  a  higher  "overlap_MDXv3"  value  than  in  the  screenshot  to  get  slightly  better  
results.
 (and  also,  as  it's  only  a  workaround,  it  will  still  process  the  audio  with  other  models,  but  they  
will
 
not
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
final
 
result
 
as
 
their
 
weights
 
=
 
0)
 (MDX23C  InstVoc-HQ  =  MDXv3  here)   You  can  also  use  the  defaults  settings  &  weights,  as  it  scores  a  bit  higher  SDR  than  InstVoc  
alone

  Be  aware  that  2.0 version  wasn’t  updated  with:   !python  -m  pip  install  ort-nightly-gpu  
--index-url=https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/ort-cuda-12-nig
htly/pypi/simple/
  Or  in  case  of  credential  issues,  you  can  try  out  this  instead:  !python  -m  pip  -q  install  onnxruntime-gpu  --extra-index-url  
https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/onnxruntime-cuda-12/pypi/
simple/
   Hence,  it’s  slow  (so  use  2.1-2.3  instead  as  they  work  as  intended  or  add  the  line  at  the  end  
of
 
the
 
first
 
cell
 
yourself)
  Explanations  on  features  added  in  2.2  Colab (2.2  might  have  more  residues  vs  2.1)  by  jarredou   What  are  BigShifts?   It's  based  on  Demucs'  shift  trick,  but  for  Demucs  it  is  limited  to  0.5  second  shifting  max  (with  
a
 
randomly
 
chosen
 
value).
 Each  BigShifts  here  shifts  the  audio  by  1  second,  no  more  random  shfiting.  f.e.  bigshifts=2,  it  will  do  1  pass  with  0  shifting,  and  a  second  pass  with  1  second  shifting,  
then
 
merge
 
the
 
results
 bigshifts=3  means  1  pass  with  0  shifting  +  1  pass  with  1  sec  shift  +  1  pass  with  2  sec  shift,  
etc...
