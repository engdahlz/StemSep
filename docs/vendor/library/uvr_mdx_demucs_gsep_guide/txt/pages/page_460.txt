 It’s  not  well  documented  on  their  promotional  materials,  but  the  option  is  available  after  
dragging
 
your
 
input
 
file
 
on
 
the
 
site,
 
and
 
then
 
under
 
drums
 
button.
  
FactorSynth  Since  version  3  available  in  a  form  of  plugin  for  most  DAWs.  Demo  runs  for  20  minutes  at  a  
time.
 
Exporting
 
and
 
component
 
editing
 
are
 
disabled.
 Till  v.  2  it  was  Ableton-only  compatible  add-on.  And  (probably)  could  be  used  on  free  Ableton  
Live.
 
  Also,  not  for  separating  drums  from  a  full  mix,  but  for  separating  your  already  separated  
drums
 
into
 
further
 
layers
 
like
 
kick,
 
snare,
 
transients,
 
cymbals,
 
etc.
 
from
 
Demucs
 
or
 
GSEP
 
(the
 
latter
 
usually
 
has
 
better
 
shakers
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
hi-hats
 
when
 
they're
 
in
 
fast
 
tempo).
  [till  v2  demo  version  limit  was  8  seconds  and  no  limit  for  full  version]”  “it’s  amazing”.   It  works  the  same  way  as  Regroover  VST  (which  may  have  some  problems  with  creating  a  
trial
 
account).
 It’s  comparable  or  better  quality  (both  better  than  zero  shot  for  at  least  drums).   “Factorsynth  has  more  granularity,  but  drumsep  is  easier  to  work  with  and  gets  less  
confused
 
between
 
toms
 
and
 
kicks.”
  There’s  a  freeware  prototype  0.4-0.1  versions  from  2017  for  Mac  available  to  download:  https://www.jjburred.com/software/factorsynth/proto.html  
Regroover  Regroover  is  only  for  30  seconds  chunks,  and  they  require  manual  align  due  to  phasing  
issues

additional
 
silence
 
is
 
added
 
in
 
the
 
beginning
 
and
 
ending.
 
 “Get  your  30-second  drum  clip,  then  drag  and  drop  it  into  Regroover.  Make  sure  to  de-select  the  Sync  option,  as  it  will  time  stretch  it  by  default.  On  the  right-hand  side,  I  recommend  changing  the  split  to  6  layers  instead  of  4,  simply  for  
flexibility.
 Once  it  has  processed  that,  you  can  choose  export  ->  layers."   There  was  a  report  that  probably  newer  versions  might  not  be  feasible  for  this  task  anymore.   In  other  words:
