    variant  in  your  DAW  when  you  set  the  same  volume  for  all  results.  The  only  way  to  not  
deteriorate
 
the
 
final
 
result
 
further,
 
is
 
to
 
delete
 
such
 
worse
 
results
 
from
 
the
 
bag
 
entirely,
 
to
 
not
 
worsen
 
the
 
final
 
outcome
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
too
 
many
 
models
 
ensembled.
 
Without
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
decreasing
 
volume
 
of
 
such
 
a
 
result
 
when
 
all
 
volumes
 
are
 
equal,
 
the
 
more
 
results
 
you'll
 
import
 
to
 
the
 
bag
 
of
 
the
 
4-5
 
the
 
best
 
models,
 
the
 
worse
 
final
 
result
 
you'll
 
get.
 
Because
 
you
 
cannot
 
compensate
 
for
 
bad
 
results
 
in
 
the
 
bag
 
by
 
decreasing
 
their
 
volume
 
like
 
in
 
avg
 
spec
 
-
 
all
 
tracks
 
are
 
equally
 
loud
 
in
 
the
 
bag
 
of
 
avg
 
to
 
the
 
models
 
with
 
good
 
results
 
-
 
hence,
 
good
 
models
 
sound
 
quieter
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
in
 
minority
 
and
 
the
 
final
 
outcome
 
is
 
worse.
 The  4-5  max  models  ensemble  rule  is  taken  from  long-conducted  tests  of  SDR  on  MVSEP  
multisong
 
leaderboard.
 
When
 
various
 
ensembles
 
were
 
tested
 
in
 
UVR,
 
most
 
of
 
these
 
combinations
 
didn't
 
consist
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
4-5
 
models,
 
because
 
above
 
that,
 
SDR
 
was
 
usually
 
dropping.
 
Usually
 
due
 
to
 
all
 
the
 
reasons
 
I
 
mentioned.
 
 Even  using  clever  methods  of  using  only  certain  frequencies  of  specific  models,  like  in  
ZFTurbo,
 
jarredou
 
and
 
Captain
 
FLAM
 
code
 
from
 
MDX23
 
(don't
 
confuse
 
with
 
MDX23C
 
arch)
 
and
 
its
 
derivations,
 
which
 
minimize
 
the
 
influence
 
of
 
"diminishing
 
returns"
 
when
 
using
 
too
 
many
 
models
 
I
 
think
 
they
 
never
 
used
 
more
 
than
 
4-5
 
in
 
their
 
bags,
 
and
 
they
 
conducted
 
impressive
 
amount
 
of
 
testing,
 
and
 
jarredou
 
even
 
focused
 
on
 
SDR
 
during
 
developing
 
his
 
fork
 
(actually
 
OG
 
ZFTurbo
 
code
 
too).
  _____   For  vocal  popping  in  instrumental  issue,  read  about  chunks or  update  UVR  to  use  a  better  option  used  automatically  (called  batch  mode)  if  you  didn't  update  to  5.6/+  for  a  long  time  
already,
 
but
 
the
 
issue
 
might
 
still
 
occur
 
on
 
GPUs
 
with
 
less
 
than
 
11GB
 
VRAM
 
(and
 
earlier
 
patches
 
doesn’t
 
have
 
Roformers
 
support).
 
 _______   MDX  v2  parameters  (e.g.  HQ_1-5,  Kim  inst,  Inst  1-3,  NET,  Crowd)  
(self.n_fft
 
/
  
dim_f
 
/
 
dim_t
 
inference
 
parameters
 
later
 
below)
 
 Segments  512  had  better  SDR  than  many  higher  values  on  various  occasions  (while  256  
has
 
lower
 
SDR,
 
and
 
has
 
almost
 
the
 
same
 
separation
 
time).
  Segments  1024  and  0.5 overlap  are  the  last  options  before  processing  time  increases  very  much.  
 
Don't
 
exceed
 
an
 
overlap
 
of
 
0.93
 
for
 
MDX
 
models,
 
it's
 
getting
 
tremendously
 
long
 
with
 
not
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
difference.
 Overlap  0.7-0.8  might  be  a  good  choice  as  well.    Segments  can  also  ditch  the  performance  AF  -  segments  2560  and  2752  (for  6GB  VRAM)  might  be  still  a  high,  but  balanced  value,  although  
not
 
fully
 
justified
 
SDR-wise,
 
as
 
512
 
or
 
640
 
can
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
higher
 
values
 
for
 
many
 
songs.
