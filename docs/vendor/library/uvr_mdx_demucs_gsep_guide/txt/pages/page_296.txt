     26.  Experimental  vocal  debleed  with  AI  for  voice   Sometimes  for  instrumental  residues  in  vocals,  AIs  for  voice  recorded  with  home  microphone  
can
 
be
 
used
 
(e.g.
 
Goyo
 
[now
 
paid
 
Supertone
 
Clear],
 
or
 
even
 
Krisp,
 
RTX
 
Voice,
 
AMD
 
Noise
 
Suppression,
 
Adobe
 
Podcast
 
as
 
a
 
last
 
resort)
 
it
 
all
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
vocals
 
and
 
how
 
destructive
 
the
 
AI
 
can
 
get.
  27.  Minimize  vocal  residues  for  very  loud  songs   For  very  loud  tracks  between  -2.5  and  -4  iLUFS,  try  to  decrease  volume  of  your  track  before  
separation.
 
E.g.
 
for
 
Ripple,
 
-3dB
 
for
 
loud
 
tracks
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
choice.
 
If
 
your
 
track
 
you’re
 
trying
 
to
 
separate
 
is
 
already
 
quiet
 
and
 
around
 
-3dB,
 
then
 
the
 
step
 
is
 
not
 
necessary.
  27b.  You  could  try  out  attenuate  volume  of  the  mixture  before  separation  (-3/6  dB),  but  I  can't  
remember
 
whether
 
current
 
MSST
 
uses
 
normalization
 
before
 
anyway.
 
UVR
 
maybe
 
not.
  28.  Brief  (old)  models  summary   MDX-Net  HQ_3  or  4  is  a  more  aggressive  model  for  instrumentals,  with  usually  fewer  
amounts
 
of
 
residues
 
vs
 
MDX23C
 
HQ
 
models
 
or
 
sometimes
 
even
 
vs
 
KaraFan
 
or
 
jarredou’s
 
MDX23
 
Colab
 
v2.3.
 
HQ_3
 
can
 
give
 
muddier
 
results
 
vs
 
competition,
 
though.
 The  most  aggressive  are  BS-Roformer  models,  but  they  can  sound  filtered  and  even  
muddier
 
at
 
times,
 
but
 
cleaner.
 
It’s
 
good
 
to
 
use
 
them
 
with
 
ensemble
 
with
 
e.g.
 
MDX23C
 
model.
  voc_ft  is  pretty  universal  for  vocals  (with  residues  in  instrumental,  but  not  less  muddy  
results),
 
while
 
people
 
also
 
liked
 
Ripple/Capcut,
 
although
 
they
 
give
 
more
 
artefacts
 
(use
 
the
 
released
 
BS-Roformer
 
models
 
now
 
for
 
vocals
 
instead).
 
Consider
 
using
 
MDX23C
 
HQ
 
model(s)
 
as
 
well,
 
but
 
they
 
tend
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
instrumental
 
residues.
  29.  Cleaning  up  bleeding  between  mics  in  multitracks   (by  SeniorPositive)   "Demucs  bleed  "pro"  tip  that  I  figured  out  now,  and  I  didn't  see  mentioned,  that  I  will  probably  
try
 
to
 
use
 
every
 
time
 
I
 
hear
 
some
 
bleed
 
between.
 
(...)
 
I
 
was
 
cleaning
 
multitrack
 
from
 
bleed
 
between
 
microphones
 
in
 
conga
 
track,
 
and
 
used
 
demucs
 
for
 
separation
 
drums/rest
 
pair,
 
and
 
[the]
 
other
 
[stem]
 
had
 
some
 
of
 
those
 
bongos
 
still,
 
very
 
very
 
low,
 
but
 
it
 
existed,
 
and
 
I
 
heard
 
it
 
just
 
enough.
 -  So  I  took  rest  signal,  boosted  it  +20db  (NOT  NORMALISE!  Other  value  but  make  note  how  
much
 
of
 
it
 
you
 
boosted,
 
go
 
few
 
dbs
 
less
 
to
 
0db
 
threshold).
 
If
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
boost
 
it
 
to
 
sensible
 
levels,
 
the
 
algorithm
 
will
 
skip
 
it.
 -  Do  separation  once  again  (this  time  I've  done  it  using  spectralayers  one,  but  it's  also  
demucs)
 -  lower  result  -20dB  add  this  result  to  first  separation  result
