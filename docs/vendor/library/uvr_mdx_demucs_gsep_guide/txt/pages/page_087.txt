 Colab  with  Roformers  -  New  Mel-Roformer  De-Crowd  model  released  on  MVSEP.  It  slightly  surpassed  SDR  of  the  
previous
 
MDX23C
 
model.
 It's  also  available  publicly  in  the  repository  below:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training  To  use  it  in  UVR,  Go  to  UVR\models  folder,  and  paste  that there.  Then  change  "dim_t"  value  to  801  at  the  very  bottom  of:  
“model_mel_band_roformer_crowd.yaml”
 
in
 
mdx_c_configs
 
subfolder.

  -  Drums  Roformer  model  shared  publicly  by  Yolkis  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/issues/1#issuecomment-2156069553 Not  totally  bad  results  as  for  7.68  SDR,  but  it  was  trained  on  subpar  GPU  for  Roformers  for  
only
 
5
 
days.
 
To
 
use
 
it
 
in
 
UVR,
 
delete

  -   (x-minus.pro)  “The  new  Strings  model  by  viperx  has  been  added!”  based  on  Mel-Roformer  
arch.
 Good  results  reported  so  far.  Sometimes  it  can  pick  up  brass.   -  (x-minus.pro)  “Demudder  has  been  added!  This  only  works  with  the  mel-roformer  inst/vocal  model.  You  need  premium  to  use  it.”  It  works  only  for  instrumentals.  Vocals  are  unaffected.  It  fills  holes  in  the  spectrum,  basing  on  
both
 
vocals
 
and
 
instrumental
 
stems
 
(e.g.
 
it
 
won’t
 
serve
 
to
 
just
 
recover
 
lossy
 
mp3).
 The  option  shows  after  you  uploaded/processed  a  track  (at  least  with  mel-roformer  model).  It’s  capable  of  providing  better  results  than  max_mag  a.k.a.  BS  and  Mel  Roformer  ensemble  
(premium),
 
depends
 
on
 
a
 
song.
 SDR-wise,  it’s  not  much  worse  than  original  model  results  (16.48  vs  17.32).   -  “New  VST  for  real  time  source  separation  (probably  same  models  [like  in]  MPC  stems)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Js5bWQWY7M https://products.zplane.de/products/peelstems/”   -  Mel-RoFormer  de-crowd  by  aufr33  and  viperx  model  files  have  been  released  publicly.
