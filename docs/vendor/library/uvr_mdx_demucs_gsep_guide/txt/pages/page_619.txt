    Used  the  same  Ratio/Attack/Release  settings  as  used  with  compressor  prior,  this  time  on  the  
side-chain
 
compressor.
  Two  templates  for  Reaper.  One  with  better  LSP  Sidechain  Limiter  Stereo  which  is  Linux  
Studio
 
Plugin
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
with
 
free
 
reacomp.
 
Target
 
is
 
around
 
-7.5
 
ilufs,
 
but
 
anything
 
between
 
8.5
 
and
 
9
 
will
 
do
 
fine.

ReaComp  struggled  more  at  some  point.  Consider  using  
e.g.
 
also
 
iZotope
 
RX9/10
 
Maximiser
 
IRC
 
IV
 
for
 
more
 
transparent
 
results.
 E.g.  Aufr33  used  Voxengo  and  sometimes  ReaXComp  in  4  channel  mode.  _______   Alternatively,  you  can  experiment  with:  KSHMR  Chain  method  by  Sam  Hocking    “I  too  get  some  residual  that  doesn't  null  when  comparing  Master  Bus  v  Distributed  Stem  
Mastering.”
 "The  way  gainmatch  works  is  it  exists  on  your  before  processing  chain  and  after  processing  
chain
 
and
 
real-time
 
communicates
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
(does
 
the
 
part
 
knock
 
is
 
showing),
 
so
 
the
 
adjustment
 
is
 
made
 
dynamically
 
as
 
a
 
gain
 
match
 
calc,
 
or
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
target
 
match
 
too.
 
While
 
the
 
loudness
 
adjusting
 
could
 
all
 
be
 
an
 
offline
 
one
 
click
 
process,
 
you
 
would
 
still
 
have
 
to
 
set
 
it
 
all
 
up
 
manually
 
in
 
a
 
DAW.
 
There
 
are
 
some
 
cool
 
duplication
 
chain-style
 
solutions
 
in
 
ProTools
 
that
 
could
 
achieve
 
it
 
more
 
easily,
 
however.
 
My
 
personal
 
favourite
 
is
 
a
 
tool
 
called
 
KSHMR
 
Chain
 
which
 
will
 
work
 
in
 
any
 
Stereo
 
DAW
 
and
 
that
 
allows
 
one
 
plugin
 
instance
 
to
 
be
 
effective
 
on
 
hundreds
 
of
 
tracks
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
but
 
controlled
 
from
 
one
 
master
 
plugin.
 
This
 
way
 
you
 
could
 
actually
 
adjust
 
every
 
single
 
audio
 
to
 
a
 
common
 
master
 
LUFS
 
dynamically
 
and
 
click
 
export
 
stems
 
and
 
all
 
would
 
be
 
dynamically
 
adjusted
 
at
 
once
 
and
 
offline
 
exported."
