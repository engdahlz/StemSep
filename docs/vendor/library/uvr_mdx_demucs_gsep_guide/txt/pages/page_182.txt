 This  inst  model  “doesn't  eliminate  vocoder  voices  well  from  an  instrumental”.  For  the  noise  in  the  model,  vs  the  ensemble  trick  on  x-minus  using  Mel-Roformer  de-noise  
might
 
be
 
better
 
alternative:
 “removes  more  noise  from  the  song  keeping  overall  instrument  quality  more  than  the  new
