    So  it  sounds  like  Zero-Shot  is  being  used  for  noise  removal.  As  for  how  Zero-Shot  and  the  noise  sample  works…   
AudioSep  “I  decided  to  try  AudioSep:  https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep on  MultiSong  Dataset.   I  used  prompt  'vocals'.  I  was  sure  it  would  be  bad,  but  I  didn't  think  it's  so  bad.  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/8408  I  also  tried  it  on  the  Guitar  dataset  -  it's  even  worse  -  negative  SDR.  Maybe  I'm  doing  
something
 
wrong.
 
But
 
I
 
tried
 
the
 
example
 
with
 
cat
 
from
 
the
 
demo
 
page,
 
and
 
it
 
worked
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
in
 
there.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
errors.”

You  might  be  able  to  fix  it  be  executing:  !pip  install  torch==2.5.0  After  you  execute  all  the  installation-related  cells.  Since  then,  probably  something  more  about  dependencies  is  also  needed,  like  it  ‘s  coded
