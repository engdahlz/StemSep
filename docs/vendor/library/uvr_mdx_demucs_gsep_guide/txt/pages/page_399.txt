Store  the  resulting  file  in  the  ROOT  of  your  UVR  installation  alongside  your  MDX  result.  8.  Finally,  ensemble  the  two  outputs  together.  cd  into  the  root  of  your  UVR  installation  and  
invoke
 
spec_utils.py
 
like
 
so:
 $  python  lib/spec_utils.py  -a  crossover  <input1>  <input2>  the  output  will  be  stored  in  the  ensembled  folder  9*  (optional).  Ensemble  the  output  from  spec_utils  with  the  output  from  UVR  4  stacked  
models
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
algorithm
  Ensemble  spec_utils.py  allowing  ensemble  is  standalone,  and  doesn't  require  UVR  installed  in  order  to  
work.
 
It
 
accepts
 
any

files
 
  mul  -  multiplies  two  spectrograms  crossover  -  mixes  the  high  frequencies  of  one  spectrogram  with  the  low  frequencies  of  
another
 
spectrogram

VR  Colab  troubleshooting   If  you  somehow  can't  mount  GDrive  in  the  VR  Colab  because  you  have  errors  or  your  
separation
 
fails:
  -  Use  the  same  account  for  Colab  and  for  mounting  GDrive  (or  you’ll  get  an  error)   -  If  you’re  on  mobile,  you  might  be  unable  to  use  Colab  without  PC  mode  checked  in  your

(although
 
now
 
it
 
works
 
without
