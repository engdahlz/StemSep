     -  Joseph  fixed  some  bugs  and  errors  in  SESA  Colab,  and  also  added  new  interface  There  are  still  some  issues  with  auto  ensemble  till  further  notice.  -  Fixed   -  unwa  released  Big  Beta  6  vocal  model |  yaml |  Colab “Although  it  belongs  to  the  Big  series,  the  characteristics  of  the  model  are  similar  to  those  of  
the
 
FT
 
series.
 
(...)
 
this
 
model
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
FT2
 
bleedless
 
with
 
the
 
dim
 
increased
 
to
 
512”
 Muddier  than  Big  Beta  5,  might  be  better  than  FT2  at  times.  
“If
 
you
 
liked
 
the
 
output
 
of
 
the
 
Big
 
Beta
 
5e
 
model,
 
you
 
may
 
not
 
like
 
6
 
as
 
much;
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
output
 
noise
 
problem
 
of
 
5e,
 
but
 
instead
 
sacrifices
 
Fullness.
 
(...)
 
Simply
 
put,
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
more
 
conservative
 
model”

  -  To  get  rid  of  noise  in  INSTV6N,  use  denoisedebleed.ckpt (yaml)  on  mixture  first,  then  use  INSTV6N  -  “for  some  reason  it  gives  cleaner  results”  (Gabox)   -  New  Gabox  model  released:  INSTV6N (noisy)  |  yaml |  Colab |  SESA |  metrics:   inst  bleedless:  32.63,  fullness:  41.68  (more  than  v1e)  
Interestingly,
 
some
 
people
 
find
 
it
 
having
 
less
 
noise
 
vs
 
v1e,
 
and
 
more
 
fullness.
 
Also,
 
it
 
has
 
more
 
fullness
 
vs
 
INSTV6,
 
and
 
more
 
noise.
 
“v1e
 
sounds
 
like
 
an
 
"overall"
 
noise
 
on
 
the
 
song,
 
while
 
v6n
 
kind
 
of
 
mixes
 
into
 
it.
 v6n  also  sounds  like  two  layers,  one  of  noise  that's  just  there.  And  the  other  one  mixes  into  
the
 
song
 
somehow.
 Using  the  phase  swap  barely  makes  it  any  better  than  phase  swapping  with  v1e  though”  -

  -  SESA  Colab  might  undergo  some  issues  with  hyper_connections  at  the  moment.  
It
 
might
 
be
 
fixed
 
tomorrow.

Done
  -  SESA  Colab  update:  Voc_Fv3  (by  Gabox)  dereverb_mel_band_roformer_mono  (by  anvuew)   MelBandRoformer4StemFTLarge  INSTV5N  (by  Gabox)   denoisedebleed  (by  Gabox)   -  Gabox  released  denoisedebleed.ckpt |  yaml |  Colab for  noise  from  fullness  models  (tested  on  v5n)  -  it  can't  remove  vocal  residues
