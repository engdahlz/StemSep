    demucs.  And  the  bass  is  solid,  some  bleed  but  the  tone  and  the  air,  the  plucking  etc  is  all  
there.
 
Plus,
 
the
 
vocals
 
are
 
nicer,
 
less
 
drift
 
into
 
the
 
'other'
 
stem.
  John  Lennon  -  Now  and  Then  (Demo)  -  Source  unknown  (16-bit  -  44.1kHz)  OK,  another  test,  this  time  on  a  John  Lennon  demo,  Now  and  Then.  The  vocals  are  solid,  
MDX23
 
at
 
0.95
 
overlap
 
is
 
catching
 
vocals
 
that
 
were
 
previously
 
in
 
htdemucs_ft
 
being
 
lost
 
to
 
the
 
piano.
 
So,
 
yeah,
 
it's
 
pretty
 
good.
 
MDX23
 
is
 
now
 
my
 
favored
 
model.
 
In
 
fact,
 
upon
 
listening
 
to
 
the
 
vocals,
 
it's
 
picking
 
up,
 
from
 
a
 
demo,
 
from
 
a
 
poor
 
recording,
 
on
 
a
 
compact
 
cassette,
 
lip
 
smacks,
 
breathing
 
and
 
other
 
little
 
non-singing
 
quirks.
 
It's
 
like
 
literally
 
going
 
back
 
and
 
having
 
John
 
record
 
in
 
multitrack.
  Queen  -  Innuendo  -  CD  Edition  TOCP-6480  (16-bit  44.1kHz)  Every  single  model  fell  down  with  Freddie  Mercury's  vocals,  not  anymore.  (...)  I've  heard  true  
vocal
 
stems
 
from
 
his
 
vocals
 
and
 
the
 
MDX23
 
separation
 
sounds
 
essentially
 
like
 
that.
 
We're
 
now
 
approaching
 
the
 
'transparent'
 
era
 
of
 
audio
 
extraction.
 NOTE:  [voc_ft  not  tested]  for  Innuendo,  will  be  tested  by  07/07/2023    Colab  instruction  by  Infisrael  for  old  versions   Install  it,  click  on  the  play  button  and  wait  until  it's  finished  (should  show  a  green  checkmark  
in
 
the
 
side).
 It  will  ask  you  for  permission  for  this  notebook  to  access  your  Google  Drive  files,  you  can  
either
 
accept
 
or
 
deny
 
it
 
(it
 
is
 
recommended
 
to
 
accept
 
it
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
Google
 
Drive
 
as
 
i/o
 
for
 
your
 
files).
  After  you've  done  installing  it,  go  to  the  configuration,  it's  below  the  'Separation'  tab.  https://i.imgur.com/qD9jsYG.png (dead)  (Recommended  settings)   Input  "`overlap_large`"  &  "`overlap_slow`"  with  what  you  desire,  at  the  highest  (1.0),  it  will  
process
 
slower
 
but
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
better
 
quality.
 
The
 
default
 
values
 
for
 
large
 
are
 
(0.6),
 
and
 
for
 
small
 
(0.5)
 
[with
 
0.8
 
still
 
being
 
balanced
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
speed
 
and
 
quality].
  Input  "`folder_path`"  with  the  folder  destination  where  you  have  uploaded  the  audio  file  you'd  
like
 
to
 
separate
 
 Input  "`output_folder`"  with  the  folder  you'd  like  the  stems  to  be  separated   Change  your  desired  path  after  `/content/drive/MyDrive/`,  so  for  example:   >  `folder_path:  /content/drive/MyDrive/input`  >  `output_folder:  /content/drive/MyDrive/output`   You  can  also  make  a  use  of  "`chunk_size`"  and  put  it  in  a  higher  value   by  a  little,  but  if  you  
experience
 
memory
 
issues,
 
lower
 
it,
 
default
 
value
 
for
 
it
 
is
 
500000.
