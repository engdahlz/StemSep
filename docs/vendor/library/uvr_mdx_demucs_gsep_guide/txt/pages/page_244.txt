     Older  4  stem  models  in  UVR  (for  some  specific  songs,  e.g.  while  trying  to  fix  bleeding  across  
stems):

(so

model
 by  Imagoy)  metrics -  MVSEP’s  SCNet  4  stem  (kick,  snare,  toms,  cymbals)  best  SDR  for  kick  and  similar  to  6s

 -  MVSEP’s  SCNet  5  stem  (cymbals,  hi-hat,  kick,  snare,  toms)  -  MVSEP’s  SCNet  6  stem  model  (ride,  crash,  hi-hat,  kick,  snare,  toms)  worse  snare  SDR   -  jarredou/Aufr33  MDX23C  model (kick/hi-hat/snare/toms/ride  and  crash  stems);  worse  overall  SDR,  but  it's  a  public  model  usable  in  UVR  or  inference  Colab   -  SpectraLayers  11  (Unmix  Drums)>OG  drumsep by  Imagoy/>FactorSynth (depending  on  how  far  you  want  to  unmix  the  drums)  >Regroover>UnMixingStation  (all  the  last  three  paid)>  Virtual  DJ  (Stems  2.0,  barely,  or  doesn’t  pick  those  instruments  at  all).   -  LarsNet  (vs  OG  drumsep,  it  also  allows  separating  hi-hats  and  cymbals,  toms  might  be  better)  -  RipX  (paid)  -  SpectraLayers  10  (paid,  sometimes  worse,  sometimes  better  than  OG  Drumsep.  IDK  if  it  
was
 
added
 
in

"drumsep
 
works
 
a
 
f*
 
ton
 
better
 
when
 
separating
 
on
 
this
 
one
 
song
 
I've
 
tested
 
with
 
the
 
pitch
 
shifted
 
down
 
2"
 -  FADR.com  (in  paid  subscription)  -  Moises.ai  (only  for  pro)   Compared  to  OG  drumsep,  Regroover  allows  more  separations,  especially  when  used  
multiple
 
times,
 
so
 
allows
 
removing
 
parts
 
of
 
kicks,
 
parts
 
of
 
snares
 
etc,
 
noises
 
etc.
 
More
 
deep
 
control.
 
Plus,
 
it
 
nulls
 
easily.
 
But
 
drumsep
 
sounds
 
better
 
on
 
its
 
own,
 
especially
 
with
 
higher
 
parameters
 
like
 
e.g.
 
shifts
 
20
 
and
 
overlap
 
0.75-0.98.
 
Now
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
replaced
 
by
 
the
 
public
 
MDX23C
 
model.
  Strings  -  Dango.ai  (e.g.  violin,  erhu;  paid,  free  30  seconds  fragments)  -  "impressive  results"  for  at  
least
 
violin
