     “With  the  new  config  editor  feature  you  could  probably  edit  the  configs  of  models  to  have  the  
vocal
 
stem
 
labelled
 
as
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
stem
 
so
 
the
 
demudder
 
demuds
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem,
 
it
 
definitely
 
still
 
makes
 
a
 
difference.
 I  accidentally  did  this  when  installing  another  model,  but  it  seems  to  actually  have  an  effect  
on
 
vocal
 
stems
 
too.
  You  just  change  the  target  instrument  from  vocals  to  instrumental  I  think  (don't  move  the  
stems
 
around)
 
 You  can  verify  it  works  if  the  stems  are  the  other  way  around  when  processing  (vocals  are  in  
the
 
file
 
labelled
 
as
 
Instrumental).
 
Then
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
the
 
demudder
 
on
 
the
 
vocals
 
that
 
way
 I  think.  If  you  want  to  use  the  demudder  with  other  models  that  aren't  labeled  with  
instrumental,
 
you'll
 
have
 
to
 
select
 
the
 
stem
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
demud
 
and
 
replace
 
it
 
with
 
Instrumental.
 Though  demudding  the  vocal  stem  will  definitely  make  it  quite  noisy  depending  on  what  model  you  use,  though  there  appears to  be  instances  where  demudding  the  vocal  stem  can  mildly  help  with  certain  effects  but  i  did  not  test  this  enough”  stephanie

“Just
 
a
 
few
 
quick
 
notes
 
on
 
the
 
Demudder:
 It  works  best  on  tracks  that  are  spectrally  dense  (ex.  Metal,  Rock,  Alternative,  EDM,  etc.)  I  don't  recommend  it  for  acoustic  or  light  tracks.  I  don't  recommend  using  it  with  models  that  emphasize  fuller  instrumentals  (like  Unwa's  v1e  
model).
 I  do  plan  on  adding  options  to  tweak  the  phase  rotation.  I  also  plan  on  adding  another  combination  method  that  may  work  better  on  certain  tracks.”

  -  BS-RoFormer  4  stems  model  by  yukunelatyh  /  SYH99999  added  on  x-minus  Since  then,  a  new  version  was  added  (later  epoch,  but  it  has  lower  SDR  for  all  stems).  https://uvronline.app/ai?discordtest Some  people  liked  the  v1  more  than  Demucs,  but  “it's  like  demucs  v4  but  worse  i  think  the  vocals  have  a  ton  of  bleed,  the  bass  is  disappointing  tbh  the  other  stem  has  a  ton  of  bgv  and  adlib  bleed  in  it”  Isling  It  has  SDR  metrics for  all  stems  worse  than  4  stem  BS-Roformer  by  ZFTurbo  and  demuics_ft.
