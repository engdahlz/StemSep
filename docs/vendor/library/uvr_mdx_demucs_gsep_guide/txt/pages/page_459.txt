[page 459/642]
    Just  be  aware,  that  if  you’re  willing  to  wait,  you  can  further  increase  shifts  to  20  if  you  want  
the
 
best
 
of
 
both
 
worlds.
  Also,  consider  testing  it  with  -6  semitones  e.g.  in  UVR  5.6/+,  or  with  31183Hz  sample  rate  
with
 
changed
 
(decreased)
 
tempo
 
and
 
pitch.
 -12  semitones  from  44100Hz  is  22050  and  should  be  rather  less  usable  in  most  cases,  the  
same
 
for
 
tempo
 
preservation,
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
off.
  Be  aware  that  sometimes  it  can  “consistently  put  hi  hats  in  snare  stem”  and  can  contain  
some
 
artefacts,
 
and
 
results
 
might
 
not
 
null
 
with
 
the
 
source.
  “From  what  I've  tested  (on  drums  already  extracted  with  demucs4_ft  from  a  live  band  
recording
 
from
 
the
 
output
 
of
 
the
 
soundboard...
 
so
 
shitty
 
sounding!),
 
It
 
is
 
quite
 
good
 
at
 
separating
 
cymbals
 
from
 
shells,
 
and
 
kick
 
from
 
snare,
 
but
 
there
 
are
 
parts
 
of
 
kick
 
or
 
snare
 
sounds
 
that
 
can
 
go
 
into
 
the
 
toms
 
stem
 
(...it's
 
easy
 
to
 
fix
 
manually
 
in
 
a
 
DAW)”
  "Ok  I  did  test  it.  -  You're  right,  Drumsep  is  good  if  shifts  are  applied,  this  makes  a  HUGE  difference,  first  time  
i
 
did
 
test
 
it
 
with
 
0
 
or
 
1
 
shift
 
and
 
results
 
were
 
meh.
  
Shifts
 
(from
 
about
 
5/6/10
 
depending
 
on
 
source)
 
clean
 
it
 
nicely.
 Minuses:  only  4  outputs.  Not  enough  for  a  lot  of  drumtracks  (but  hey  you  can  Regroove  
results,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
what
 
i
 
will
 
be
 
doing
 
probably
 
from
 
now)
 
-
 
It
 
takes
 
a
 
long
 
time
 
with
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
shifts,
 
-
 
it
 
doesnt
 
null
 
with
 
original
 
tracks
 -  Regroove  allows  me  more  separations,  especially  when  used  multiple  times,  so  as  a  
producer
 
it
 
allows
 
me
 
to
 
remove
 
parts
 
of
 
kicks,
 
parts
 
of
 
snares
 
etc,
 
noises
 
etc.
 
More
 
deep
 
control.
 
Plus
 
it
 
nulls
 
easily
 
(it
 
always
 
adds
 
the
 
same
 
space
 
in
 
front)
 
so
 
I
 
can
 
work
 
more
 
transparently.
 
 But  you're  right,  I  will  use  drumsep  in  the  Colab  with  a  lot  of  shifts  as  a  starting  point  in  most  
cases
 
now."
  "It's  trained  with  7  hours  of  drum  tracks  that  I  made  using  sample-based  drum  software  like  
Adictive
 
Drums,
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
as
 
many
 
different-sounding
 
drums
 
as
 
I
 
could.
 
As
 
everything
 
was
 
controlled
 
with
 
MIDI,
 
I
 
could
 
export
 
the
 
isolated
 
bodies:
 
kick,
 
snare,
 
toms
 
(all
 
on
 
one
 
track),
 
and
 
cymbals
 
(including
 
hi-hat).
 
So
 
every
 
dataset
 
example
 
is
 
composed
 
of
 
kick,
 
snare,
 
toms,
 
cymbals,
 
and
 
the
 
mixture
 
(the
 
sum
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
them)."

  From  paid  solutions  for  separating  drums'  sections  there  is  mainly  a  paid  FactorSynth and  other  alternatives  are  more  problematic  or  less  perfect.   Use  free  zero  shot  for  separating  single  other  instruments  from  e.g.  others  stem  from  
Demucs
 
or
 
GSEP.
