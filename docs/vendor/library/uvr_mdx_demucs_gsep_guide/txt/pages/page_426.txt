music.ai  Paid  -  $25  per  month  or  pay  as  you  go  (pricing  chart).  In  fact,  no  free  trial.   Good  selection of  models  and  interesting  module  stacking feature.    To  upload  files  instead  of  using  URLs  “you  make  the  workflow,  and  you  start  a  job  from  the  
main

that

  Allegedly  it’s  made  by  Moises  team,  but  the  results  seem  to  be  better  than  those  on  Moises.   “Bass  was  a  fair  bit  better  than  Demucs  HT,  Drums  about  the  same.  Guitars  were  very  good  
though.
 
Vocal
 
was
 
almost
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
my
 
cleaned
 
up
 
work.

An

I've
 
worked
 
with
 
demixed
 
to
 
almost
 
the

results,
 
it
 
took
 
me
 
a
 
few
 
hours
 
and
 
achieve
 
it
 
39
 
seconds”

I'd
 
say
 
a
 
little
 
clearer
 
than
 
MVSEP

Ensemble.
 
It
 
seems
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
instrument
 
bleed
 
out
 
quite
 
well,”
 
 “Beware,  I've  experienced  some  very  weird  phase  issues  with  music.ai.  I  use  if  for  bass,  but  
vocals
 
are
 
too
 
filtered
 
/
 
denoised
 
imo
 
and
 
you
 
can't
 
choose
 
to
 
not
 
filter
 
it
 
all
 
so
 
heavily.”
