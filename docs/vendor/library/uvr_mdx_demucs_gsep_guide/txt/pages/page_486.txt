     In  specific  cases,  some  streaming  services  might  not  have  FLAC  for  your  song,  then  use  
other
 
streaming
 
service.
  0)  https://tidal.qqdl.site -  TIDAL  (doesn’t  seem  like  it  downloads  anything  higher  than  16/44  when  file  quality  is  Max,  but  ensure;  some  smartphones  might  run  out  of  memory  running  
this,

  0)  https://tidal.squid.wtf/ -  TIDAL   *)  yams.tf (now  very  simple  registration  without  email  is  required;  based  on  song  search,  it  allows  playing  the  files  in  your  browser  in  FLAC  and  creating  your  own  playlists.

Didn’t
 
check
 
what
 
streaming
 
service
 
it
 
uses
 
now.
 Before,  it  supported  Qobuz,  Tidal,  Deezer,  Spotify  and  Apple  Music  only  in  320  kbps,  and  
worked
 
only
 
with
 
URLs.
   Telegram  ripping  bots   Note :  To  use  Telegram  in  a  browser,  visit  https://web.telegram.org/ You  need  the  app  installed  and  an  account  registered  on  your  phone,  and  then  QR  code  
from
 
there
 
is
 
needed.
  1a)  Bot   https://t.me/onlydonuts  1b)  Amazon  bot  (up  to  24/96  FLAC)  https://t.me/GlomaticoAmazonMusicBot  Q:  “I  hit  start  bot,  but  nothing  happens”  
A:
 
“Once
 
you
 
start
 
the
 
bot,
 
you
 
must
 
type
 
/codec
 
and
 
send,
 
then
 
it
 
will
 
show
 
a
 
menu
 
where
 
you
 
pick
 
the
 
format
 
you
 
want
 
(mp3,
 
flac,
 
atmos)
 After  selecting  a  codec,  you  simply  need  to  send  a  link  to  a  track  or  album.  The  bot  will  download  all  the  tracks  in  the  format  you  pick,  but  if  the  track  is  not  available  in  
Atmos
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
ignored”
