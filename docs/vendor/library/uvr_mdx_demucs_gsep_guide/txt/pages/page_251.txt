    -  GSEP  (sometimes),  and  e.g.  drums  stem  is  able  to  remove  applauses   -  Chant  model (by  HV,  VR  arch,  e.g.  works  for  applauses;  may  leave  some  echo  to  separate  with  other  models  or  tools  below)  for  Colab  usage  -  you  need  to  copy  that  model  to  
models/v5
 
and
 
then
 
use

turn

and
 
set
 
it

  “For  really  difficult  live  songs  (where  the  crowd  is  overwhelmingly  loud  to  the  point  where  you  
can't
 
hear
 
the
 
band
 
properly)

THEN
 
running
 
the
 
vocals

through
 
the
 
mdx

sometimes
 
helps”
  SFX  -  “You  do  need  to  first  get  an  instrumental  with  a  different  model,  because  this  isn't  really  
trained
 
to
 
remove
 
vocals.
 
Just
 
SFX”
 
or
 
speech.
 -  SFX  models  can  be  more  aggressive  than  regular  vocal  models  for  speech.  Sometimes,  some  of  the  regular  vocal  models  may  turn  out  to  be  better  suited  for  your  task,  
so
 
try
 
out
 
those
 
for
 
speech
 
too.
  -  BS-Roformer  SW  drums  -  “really  good  to  remove  some  SFX  and  foley,  way  better  than

 a)  SCNet   b)  MelBand   (better  metrics  than  Bandit  v2)    -  Bandit  v2  (MVSEP  |  OG  weights |  yaml)  multilingual  model  (multi)   or  single  ones  for  EN/GER/FR/SPA/CH/FAR  language.   All  models converted  (yaml)  for  ZFTurbo  inference  |  Colab |   in  UVR>MDX-Net>Download  More  Models>Bandit  v2/Plus  (v2  is  better  on  speech  vs  Bandid  Plus,  not  always  on  SFX  -  experiment).  “Multilingual  model  is  most  of  the  time  giving  better  results  than  French  model  for  French  
content,
 
so
 
I
 
would
 
start
 
with
 
it”
