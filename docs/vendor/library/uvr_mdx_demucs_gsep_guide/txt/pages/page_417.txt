    Also,  we  have  overall  better  separation  quality  results  using  shifts=10,  but  it  increases  
separation
 
time
 
(it's
 
also
 
reflected
 
by
 
MVSEP's
 
SDR
 
calculations).
 
Overlaps
 
also
 
increase
 
general
 
separation
 
quality
 
for
 
instrumentals/vocals,
 
at
 
least
 
up
 
to
 
0.75,
 
but
 
everything
 
above
 
starts
 
being
 
tremendously
 
slow
 
(few
 
hours
 
for
 
0.99
 
max
 
setting).
  If  you  use  particularly  high  overlap  like  0.96  for  a  full  length  song,  you  can  run  out  of  Colab  
time
 
limit
 
if
 
it’s
 
not
 
your
 
first
 
file
 
being
 
processed
 
during
 
this
 
session
 
(for
 
cases
 
when
 
processing
 
takes
 
more
 
than
 
1
 
hour).
 
If
 
you
 
exceed
 
the
 
limit,
 
you
 
can
 
change
 
Google
 
account
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
top
 
(don’t
 
use
 
other
 
account
 
during
 
mounting,
 
or
 
you’ll
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
error).
 
The
 
limit
 
is
 
reset
 
after
 
12
 
hours
 
(maybe
 
sooner).
 
It’s
 
capable
 
of
 
processing
 
one
 
file
 
for
 
two
 
hours,
 
at
 
least
 
only
 
if
 
it’s
 
the
 
first
 
file
 
being
 
processed
 
for
 
a
 
longer
 
time
 
during
 
this
 
day.
 
Also,
 
rarely,
 
it
 
can
 
happen
 
that
 
your
 
file
 
is
 
being
 
processed
 
faster
 
than
 
usual
 
despite
 
the
 
same
 
T4
 
GPU.
 
 If  you  have  “something  has  gone  terribly  wrong ”  error  right  on  the  separation  start,  simply  
retry.
 
If
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
long
 
separation
 
-
 
ignore
 
it,
 
and
 
don’t
 
retry
 
-
 
your
 
result
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
folder.
  -  *clipclamp*  -  uncheck  it  to  disable  hard  limiter,  but  it  may  cause  separation  artifacts  on  
some
 
loud
 
input
 
files
 
or
 
will
 
change
 
volume
 
proportions
 
of
 
the
 
stems.
 
I
 
like
 
it
 
enabled
 
somehow.
  -  Q:  How  to  stop  Demucs  from  rescaling  the  volume  of  stems  after  they're  extracted  (without  
adjusting
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
the
 
input
 
mixture
 
and
 
passing
 
--clip-mode=clamp)?
 A:  Set  “”--clip-mode  none  argument  coupled  with  export  to  --float32”  (jarredou)  Picture  Demucs  parameters  explained  by  jarredou    -  “Overlap  is  the  percentage  of  the  audio  chunk  that  will  be  overlapped  by  the  next  audio  
chunk.
 
So
 
it's
 
basically
 
merging
 
and
 
averaging
 
different
 
audio
 
chunk
 
that
 
have
 
different
 
start
 
(&
 
end)
 
points.
  For  example,  if  audio  chunk  is  `|---|`  with  overlap=0.5,  each  audio  chunk  will  be  half  
overlapped
 
by
 
next
 
audio
 
chunk:
  ```          |---|        |---|      |---|  etc...    |---|  (2nd  audio  chunk  half  overlapping  previous  one)  |---|  (1st  audio  chunk)  ```   -shifts  is  a  random  value  between  0  and  0.5  seconds  that  will  be  used  to  pad  the  full  audio  
track,
 
changing
 
its
 
start(&end)
 
point.
 
When
 
all
 
"shifts"
 
are
 
processed,
 
they
 
are
 
merged
 
and
 
average.
