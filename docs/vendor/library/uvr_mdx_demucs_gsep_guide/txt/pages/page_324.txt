[page 324/642]
    our  SDR  chart at  the  time,  available  in  Colab  update and  UVR5  GUI with  VIP  models  package -  now  available  for  free.   -  Forth-best  single  model  for  instrumentals  back  then  was  inst  main  (496,  MDX  2.1),  then  
inst
 
1
 
and
 
inst2.
  -  There  was  some  confusion  about  MDX  2.1  model  (iirc  on  x-minus)  being  vocal  438  (even  
411),
 
but
 
it’s
 
currently
 
inst
 
main.
  -  Full  band  MDX-Net  models  without  cutoff  (better  SDR  than  Demucs  4  ft)  As  for  SDR,  the  epochs  score  is  following:  292<403<386<(inst  1)<338<382<309<337  <450  (first  final,  HQ_1)<498  (HQ_2)<(inst3)<(Kim  inst)<HQ_3<HQ_4   Epochs  292,  403  and  450  and  newer  are  also  in  Colab (and  in  UVR5,  older  when  VIP  code  is  redeemed)   -  (currently  the  best,  maybe  not  single  model,  but  custom  ensemble,  as  for  vocals)  MDX23  in  MVSEP  beta,    and  in  UVR5  -  Kim  vocal  model  -   It's  a  further  trained  MDX-UVR  vocal  model  from  their  last  epoch  (probably  UVR-MDX-NET  
Main).
 
It's
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
higher
 
n_fft
 
scale
 
which
 
uses
 
more
 
resources.
 Not  always  gives  that  good  results  for  instrumental  as  SDR  may  suggest,  and  also  more  
people
 
shares
 
that
 
opinion
 
[both
 
Colab
 
and
 
UVR
 
users,
 
so
 
i’ts
 
not
 
due
 
to
 
no
 
cutoff
 
in
 
Colab]).
 In  UVR5  generally  for  the  best  vocal  result  use  vocal  models,  and  for  the  best  instrumental  
result
 
use
 
instrumental
 
models
 
or
 
eventually

stem
 
Demucs

ft.
  "[Kim_Vocal_1]  is  an  older  model  (November),  than  Kim  uploaded  at  2022-12-04  to"  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/leaderboard.php?sort=insrum&ensemble=0  (steps  below  no  longer  necessary,  the  model  is  added  to  GUI  and  these  are  the  same  
models)
 You  can  download  her  (so-called  “old”)  model  from  here  (it  still  gets  better  results  for  vocals  
than
 
inst
 
3
 
and
 
main):
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exdP1CkpYHUuKsaz-gApS-0O1EtB0S82?usp=sharing When  you  copy/paste  the  model  in  
`C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Ultimate
 
Vocal
 
Remover\models\MDX_Net_Models`
 
It
 
asks
 
you
 
to
 
configure,
 
hit
 
Yes.
 Then  change  `n_fft  to  7680`."  For  instrumentals,  it  gets  worse  results,  frequently  with  more  bleeding,  and  UVR  manually  
applies
 
cutoff
 
above
 
training
 
frequency
 
to
 
instrumentals
 
after
 
inversion,
 
to
 
avoid
 
some
 
noise
 
and
 
possibly
 
bleeding.
 
Colab
 
version
 
of
 
Kim
 
model
 
doesn’t
 
have
 
that
 
cutoff,
 
so
 
instrumentals
