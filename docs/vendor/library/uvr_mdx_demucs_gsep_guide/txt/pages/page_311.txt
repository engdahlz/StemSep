    Random  noise  added  to  results  can  increase  fullness  metric:  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/7709 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/7708 “l1  freq,  the  simplest  way  to  explain  it  -  it’s  a  mix  between  fullness  and  bleedless  but  without

a
 
sense
 
it’s
 
the

  “-l1_freq  =  bleedless  (higher  is  cleaner)  -aura_mrstft  =  fullness  (higher  is  fuller)  they  maybe  don’t  have  the  issues  fullness  and  bleedless  have  but  I  haven’t  played  to  check  
that”

  Read  for  discussion  “[The]  problem  with  bleedless/fullness  metric  is  that  you  can  easily  increase  them  by  
multiplying
 
stem
 
on
 
constant.
 Multiply  predictions  by  0.97  -  it  increases  fullness  and  reduces  bleedless  Multiply  predictions  by  1.03  -  it  greatly  increases  bleedless  and  reduces  fullness”  -  ZFTurbo (metrics/discussion)   Other  metrics:   Log  WMSE  -  good  “at  least  for  drums  or  anything  rich  in  low  frequency  content”  -  jarredou  "It  is  a  relatively  new  time-domain  metric  over  SDR  and  SI-SDR  that  is  not  overly  sensitive  to

 In  addition,  time-domain  metrics  can  be  evaluated  for  both  amplitude  and  phase."  -  Unwa  Metrics  ignore  phase,  so  probably  phase  fixer  won't  affect  fullness/bleeedless  metric.

 While  V1e+  (37.89)  might  be  already  muddy  in  some  cases
