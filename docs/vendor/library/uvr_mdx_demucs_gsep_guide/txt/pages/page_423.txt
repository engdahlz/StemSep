     GSEP  is  generally  good  for  tracks  where  using  all  the  previous  methods  you  had  bleeding  
(e.g.
 
low-pitched
 
hip-hop
 
vocals)
 
or
 
got
 
flute
 
sounds
 
removed,
 
although
 
it
 
struggles
 
with
 
“cuts”
 
and
 
heavily
 
processed
 
vocals
 
in
 
e.g.
 
choruses.
 
Though,
 
it
 
has
 
more
 
bleeding
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
when
 
the
 
very
 
first
 
model
 
didn't,
 
so
 
new
 
MDX-UVR
 
models
 
can
 
achieve
 
generally
 
better
 
results
 
now.
  "GSEP  is  good  at  piano  extraction,  but  it  still  lacks  in  vocal  separation,  in  many  times  the  
instruments
 
come
 
out
 
together
 
with
 
the
 
voices,
 
this
 
is
 
annoying
 
sometimes."
  Electric  guitar  model  got  worse  in  the  last  update  in  some  cases.  Also,  bass  &  drums  also  
not
 
so
 
loud
 
since
 
the
 
first
 
release
 
of
 
gsep.
 "Electric  guitar  model  barely  picks  up  guitars,  it  doesn't  compare  to  Demix/lalal/Audioshake".  “I  kinda  like  it.  When  it  works  (that's  maybe  50-60%  of  time),  it's  got  merit.”  
The
 
issue
 
happens
 
(also?)
 
when
 
you
 
process
 
(GSEP)
 
instrumental
 
via
 
5
 
stems.
 
If
 
you
 
process
 
a
 
regular
 
song
 
with
 
vocals
 
-
 
it
 
picks
 
up
 
guitar
 
correctly.
 
It
 
happens
 
only
 
in
 
a
 
place
 
where
 
previously
 
was
 
vocal
 
removed
 
by
 
GSEP
 
2
 
stem.
 I  only  tested  GSEP  instrumental  so  far,  I  don’t  know  whether  it  happens  on  official  
instrumentals
 
too
 
(maybe
 
not).
  The  cool  thing  is  that  when  the  guitar  model  works  (and  it  grabs  the  electric),  the  remaining  
'other'
 
stem
 
often
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
way
 
to
 
hear
 
acoustic
 
guitar
 
layers
 
that
 
are
 
otherwise
 
hidden.
 
 The  biggest  thing  I'd  like  to  see  work  done  on  is  the  bass  training.  At  present,  it  can't  detect  
the
 
higher
 
notes
 
played
 
up
 
high...
 
whereas
 
Demucs3/B
 
can
 
do
 
it
 
extremely
 
well.”
  It  has  “much  superior”  other  stem  than  Demucs  or  even  better  than  Audioshake.  It  has  
changed
 
since
 
6
 
September
 
2022,
 
but
 
probably
 
got
 
updated
 
since
 
then
 
and
 
is
 
probably
 
fine.
 
  As  for  14.10.22  piano  model  sounds  “very  impressive”.   As  for  the  first  version  of  the  model  comparable  vocal  stem  to  MDX-UVR  9.7,  but  with  
current
 
limitation
 
to
 
mp3
 
320kbps
 
and
 
worse
 
drums
 
and
 
bass
 
than
 
Demucs
 
(not
 
in
 
all
 
cases).
 
Usually
 
less
 
bleeding
 
in
 
instrumentals
 
than
 
VR
 
architecture
 
models.
  “Gsep  sounds  like  a  mix  between  Demucs  3  and  Spleeter/lalal,  because  the  drums  are  kind  
of
 
muffled,
 
but
 
it's
 
so
 
confident
 
when
 
removing
 
vocals,
 
there
 
aren't
 
as
 
many
 
noticeable
 
dips
 
like
 
other
 
filtered
 
instrumentals,
 
and
 
it
 
picks
 
up
 
drums
 
more
 
robustly
 
than
 
Demucs.
 
[it
 
can
 
be
 
better
 
in
 
isolating
 
hihats
 
then
 
Demucs
 
4
 
ft
 
model
 
too]
 It  removes  vocals  more  steadily  and  takes  away  some  song's  atmospheres,  rather  than  UVR  
approach
 
which
 
tries
 
to
 
preserve
 
the
 
atmosphere,
 
but
 
[in
 
UVR]
 
you
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
vocal
 
artefacts”
