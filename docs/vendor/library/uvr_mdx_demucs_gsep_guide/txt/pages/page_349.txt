[page 349/642]
    We’ve  tested  various  DirectML.dll  libraries  major  versions  since  1.9  (and  besides  1.12  and  
1.14),
 
up
 
to
 
1.15.4,
 
and
 
the
 
one
 
attached
 
with
 
UVR
 
(1.10.1.0)
 
was
 
the
 
fastest
 
(1.5.1.0
 
didn’t
 
work).

processing
 
time,
 
so
 
the
 
opposite
 
to
 
what's
 
in
 
patches
 
newer

#2)
  In  addition  to  the  above  -   for  CPU-only:   -  MDX-Net  HQ_3  in  UVR  with  CPU  takes  2  minutes  with  Ryzen  5  3600  (some  regular  song  
time)
  -  HQ_4  takes  ~13  minutes  on  C2Q  @3.6  DDR2  on  CPU,  6GB  RAM  with  default  settings    -  HQ_3  for  4:19  track  takes  20  minutes  and  22  seconds  (default overlap  and  256  segments,  iirc  default  too)    -  HQ_4  is  much  faster  on  the  same  CPU   -  On  AMD  A6-9225  Dual-Core  CPU  (2/2),  4GB  RAM  three  models  ensemble  (MDX,  MDX,  
Demucs
 
4)
 
it
 
took
 
almost
 
17
 
hours.
  -  On  i3  3xxx  it  took  around  8  hours  (not  sure  about  song  elapsed  time).    -  The  main  burden  in  this  ensemble  on  such  configuration  is  Demucs   -  MDX23C  and  Demucs  ht/ft  cannot  be  processed  under  ~5-17  hours  without  GPU  
acceleration
 
with
 
CPU-only
 
using
 
C2Q.
 
Probably
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
Roformers.
  -   MDX-Net  HQ_3/4  models  and  VR  models  with  512  window  size  are  fine  on  the  same  
configuration
  -  MDX-Net  HQ_3  in  UVR  with  CPU  takes  2  minutes  with  Ryzen  5  3600  -  for  unknown  regular  
song
 
between
 
2-4
 
minutes)
  -  HQ_4  takes  ~13  minutes  on  C2Q  @3.6  DDR2  with  default  settings  (and  it’s  faster  than  
HQ_3)
 
-
 
for
 
uknown
 
regular
 
song
 
between
 
2-4
 
minutes)
