    -  Audioshake  3  stem  model  is  added  to  https://myxt.com/ for  free  demo  accounts.  Unfortunately,  it  has  WAVs  with  16kHz  cutoff  which  Audioshake  normally  doesn't  have.  No  
other
 
stem.
 
Results,
 
maybe
 
slightly
 
better
 
than
 
Demucs.
 Might  be  good  for  vocals.   -  Spectralayers  10  received  an  update  of  an  AI,  and  they  no  longer  use  Spleeter,  but  
Demucs
 
4,
 
and
 
they
 
now
 
also
 
good
 
kick,
 
snare,
 
cymbals
 
separation
 
too.
 
Good
 
opinions
 
so
 
far.
 
Compared
 
to
 
drumsep
 
sometimes
 
it's
 
better,
 
sometimes
 
it's
 
not.
 
Versus
 
MDX23
 
Colab
 
V2,
 
instrumentals
 
sometimes
 
sound
 
much
 
worse.
 
“SpectraLayers
 
is
 
great
 
for
 
taking
 
Stems
 
from
 
UVR
 
and
 
then
 
carrying
 
on
 
separating
 
further
 
and
 
editing
 
down.

  -  (?  some)  MDX  Colabs  started  causing  errors  of  insufficient  driver  version.   >  "As  a  temp  workaround  you  can  go  to  "Tools"  in  the  main  menu,  and  "Command  Palette",  
and
 
search
 
for
 
"Use
 
fallback
 
runtime
 
version",
 
and
 
click
 
on
 
it,
 
this
 
will
 
restart
 
the
 
notebook
 
with
 
the
 
previous
 
Ubuntu
 
version
 
in
 
Colab,
 
and
 
things
 
should
 
works
 
as
 
they
 
were
 
before
 
(at
 
least
 
till
 
mid
 
July
 
or
 
earlier
 
[how
 
it
 
was
 
once]
 
where
 
it

probably
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
fixed.
 X:  Some  people  have  an  error  that  fallback  runtime  is  unavailable.   -  New  v2  version  of  ZFTurbo's  MDX23  Colab released  by  jarreadou  (now  also  with  denoiser  off  memory  fix  added).  Now  it  should  have  less  bleeding  in  general.  It  includes  models  changed  for  better  ones  (Kim  Vocal  2  and  HQ_3),  volume  compensation,  
fullband
 
of
 
vocals,
 
higher
 
frequency
 
bleeding
 
fix.
 
It
 
all
 
manifests
 
in
 
increased
 
SDR.
 Instrum  is  inverted  of  vocals  stem  Instrum2  is  the  sum  of  drums+bass+other  stems  (I  used  to  prefer  it,  but  most  people  rarely  
see
 
any
 
difference
 
between
 
both,
 
and
 
it
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
specific
 
fragments,
 
although
 
instrum
 
gets
 
better
 
SDR
 
and
 
is
 
less
 
muddy,
 
so
 
it’s
 
rather
 
better
 
to
 
stick
 
with
 
instrum)
 If  your  separation  ends  up  instantly  with  path  written  below,  you  wrongly  wrote  it  in  the  cell.  Simply  remove  the  `file  -  name.flac`  at  the  end  and  leave  only  path  leading  to  a  file.  It's  organized  in  a  way  that  it  catches  all  files  within  that  path/folder.  Suggestion:  go  to  drive.google.com  and  create  a  folder  `input`,  and  drop  the  tracks  you  want  to  process  in  there.  When  the  process  is  done,  delete  them,  and  add  others  you  want  to  process.   Overlap  large  and  small  are  the  main  settings,  higher  values  =  slightly  higher  score,  but  way  
longer
 
processing.
 Colab  doesn't  allow  much  higher  value  for  chunk  size,  but  you  can  try  little  higher  ones  and  
see
 
when
 
it
 
crashes
 
because
 
of
 
memory.
 
Higher
 
chunk
 
size
 
give
 
better
 
results.
 -  Updated inference  with  voc_ft  model  (Colab v2.1  has  denoiser  now  on,  but  updated  inference  not  and  is  essentially  what  2.2  currently  is).  -  Volume  compensation  fine-tuning  -  it  is  in  line  359  (voc_ft),  388  (for  ensembling  the  vocals  
stem),
 
394
 
(for
 
HQ_3
 
instrumental
 
stem
 
inversion).
