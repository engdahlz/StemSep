“seems
 
to
 
give
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
fv4”,
 
also
 
 -  Mel  2024.10  is  mentioned  in  MVSEP  section,  but  BS-Roformer  2025.07  now  has  all  the  
metrics
 
better,
 
 -  unwa  beta6/x  +  voc_fv4  ensemble  is  also  good  for  RVC,   -  unwa  beta  4  was  better  than  big  beta  v5e  (NotEddy/codename),  research  also  
voc_gabox2)
 -  “deux  vocal  stem  has  more  backing  vocals  than  gabox  fv7  beta  1-3  and  other  models  I've  
ever
 
tried,
 
but
 
it
 
may
 
be
 
rather
 
noisy
 
on
 
silent
 
parts
 
or
 
fadeouts”
