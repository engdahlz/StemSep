[page 4/642]
    it  doesn't  sound  that  bleedless  to  me,  due  to  that  reason.  (...)  there's  some  noise  during  some  quieter  parts  but  I'll  def  be  adding  this  to  the  list  of  
models
 
I
 
use.
 
I
 
was
 
testing
 
against
 
fv7beta2,
 
during
 
louder
 
parts
 
there
 
seemed
 
to
 
be
 
less
 
noise,
 
but
 
during
 
quieter
 
parts
 
there
 
seemed
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
noise
 
(...)
 
I'll
 
prob
 
use
 
fv7beta2
 
for
 
the
 
most
 
part
 
still,
 
but
 
I'll
 
try
 
adding
 
hyperace
 
vocal
 
model
 
to
 
the
 
mix
 
of
 
models
 
I
 
use.
 
lol,
 
soon
 
I'll
 
be
 
using
 
10
 
models
 
throughout
 
one
 
song”

  Note:  It  uses  its  own  inference  script  (bs_roformer.py)  different  from  the  previous  one,  and  
it’s
 
also
 
incompatible
 
with
 
UVR.
 
“You
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
model
 
by
 
replacing
 
the
 
MSST
 
repository's
 
models/bs_roformer.py
 
with
 
the
 
repository's
 
bs_roformer.py.”
 To  not  affect  functionality  of  other  BS-Roformer  models  by  that  file,  so  older  BS-Roformers  
will
 
still
 
work,
 
you
 
can
 
add
 
it
 
as
 
new
 
model_type
 
by
 
editing
 
utils/settings.py
 
and
 models/bs_roformer/init.py  here (thx  anvuew).  For  error  while  installing  the  py  file  for  HyperACE  model  in  Sucial’s  WebUI:  from  models.bs_roformer.attend  import  Attend  ModuleNotFoundError:  No  module  named  'models'"  The  fix:  “SUC-DriverOld/MSST-WebUI  use  the  name  "modules"  and  
ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training
 
use
 
the
 
name
 
"models".
 
And
 
Unwa's
  
bs_roformer.py
 
that
 
you
 
replace
 
with,
 
also
 
use
 
"models".
 
So
 
you'll
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
coding
 
and
 
symlink
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
work.”

  Training  details:  “In  v2,  the  TFC-TDF  module  used  in  models  like  the  MDX23C  has  been  
added
 
to
 
the
 
FreqPixelShuffle
 
module.
 Additionally,  frequency-domain  downsampling  is  now  performed  downstream  of  the  
Backbone
 
module.”
  -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  a  new  Crowd  removal  model  based  on  BSRoformer  architecture.  It's  
available
 
in
 
"MVSep
 
Crowd
 
removal
 
(crowd,
 
other)"
 
with
 
name
 
"BS
 
Roformer
 
(SDR
 
crowd:
 
7.21)".
 
SDR
 
increased
 
from
 
6.27
 
up
 
to
 
7.21.”

 Some  people  have  issues  with  it:  "The  6.27  one  removed  all  kinds  of  crowd  noises,  sound  effects  and  general  noise,  this  one  
only
 
removes
 
random
 
bits
 
of
 
music!"
  -  HyperACE  model  added  to  uvronline.app   -  Gabox  uploaded  an  experimental  “test”  model  “instmel.ckpt”  loosely  on  some  hosting  
“(muddy,
 
no
 
losses)”
