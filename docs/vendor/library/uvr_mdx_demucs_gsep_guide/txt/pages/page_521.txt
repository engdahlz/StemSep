     If  you  can,  use  Izotope  RX-8  for  22kHz  4  stem,  as  it  provides  better  separation  quality  with  
aggressiveness
 
option.
 
It’s
 
Spleeter,
 
but
 
with
 
better
 
model
 
(full
 
band).
  Demucs  3.0  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyEe0m8t5b3i9FQkCl_iy6c9maF2brGx?usp=sharing  To  install  it  locally  (by  britneyjbitch):   I  cracked  the  Da  Vinci  code  on  how  to  install  Demucs  V3  sweat_smile  For  anybody  who  
struggled
 
(on
 
Windows)
 
-
 
I
 
got
 
you!
 1.  DL  a  zip  folder  of  Demucs  3  from  Github  (link:  
https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs)
 
and
 
extract
 
it
 
in
 
a
 
desired
 
folder
 2.  Inside  the  extracted  folder  run  cmd  3.  If  you  want  to  simply  separate  tracks,  run  the  following  command:                    python.exe  -m  pip  install  --requirement  requirements_minimal.txt  4.  If  you  want  to  be  able  to  train  models  too,  run  the  following  command:                    python.exe  -m  pip  install  --requirement  requirements.txt  5.  If  a  read  error  for  incompatible  versions  of  any  of  the  modules  appears  (e.g.  torch)  run  the  
following
 
command:
                   pip  install  desired_module==version_of_desired_module                    e.g.   pip  install  torch==1.9.0  6.  Repeat  step  5  for  any  incompatibilities  that  might  occur  7.  Separating  tracks:            python.exe  -m  demucs   -n  "desired_model_to_run_separation"  "path_to_track"  8.  If  you  want  help  finding  all  additional  options  (for  example  overlap  or  shifts),  run:            python.exe  -m  demucs  --help  At  least  that  worked  for  me,  feel  free  to  let  me  know  if  this  worked  for  others  as  well  exclamation  Oh,  and  I  forgot  -  between  step  6  or  7,  don't  pay  attention  to  a  potential  red  error  
''torchvision
 
0.9.1+cu111
 
has
 
requirement
 
torch==1.8.1,
 
but
 
you'll
 
have
 
torch
 
1.9.0
 
which
 
is
 
incompatible.''
 Do  NOT  change  back  to  torch  1.8.0  cuz  you  won't  be  able  to  run  demucs  warning!  If  ''torchvision  0.9.1+cu111  has  requirement  torch==1.8.1,  but  you'll  have  torch  1.9.0  
which
 
is
 
incompatible.''
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
red
 
error
 
you're
 
getting
 
after
 
executing
 
the
 
commands
 
from
 
step
 
3,4
 
and/or
 
5,
 
you're
 
good
 
to
 
go
 
with
 
separation!
