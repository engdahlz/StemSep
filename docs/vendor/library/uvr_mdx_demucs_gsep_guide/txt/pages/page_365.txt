  Music  Source  Separation  Colab  by  jarredou Single  models  inference  kept  upd  to  date  -  new  MDX23C  Drumsep  model,  most  if  not  all  
Roformers
 
(now
 
also
 
/w
 
1053,
 
and
 
unwa/Gabo
 
models),
 
plus
 
VitLarge,
 
and
 
Bandid
 
model
 
support
 
for
 
SFX
 
and
 
MelBand
 
Decrowd,
 
plus
 
experimental
 
SCNet,
 
and
 
both
 
MDX23C
 
and
 
Mel-Roformer
 
dereverb.
 
 
Based
 
on
 
ZFTurbo
 
inference
 
repo
 
(optimized
 
dependencies
 
and
 
frozen
 
commit
 
to
 
avoid
 
issues).
 No  BigShifts  here,  and  fixed  overlap  issues  with  Roformers  from  UVR.  Use  drumsep  on  already  separated  drums  from  already  good  sounding  instrumental.  Use  4  stem  models  at  best  on  already  well  separated  instrumental  with  a  single  model.  
Detailed
 
instruction
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
Colab:
 https://rentry.org/msst-colab  Q:  What  is  TTA  option?  A:  “It  means  "test  time  augmentation",  with  ZFTurbo's  script,  it  will  do  3  passes  on  the  audio  
file
 
instead
 
of
 
1.
 
1
 
pass
 
with
 
be
 
with
 
original
 
audio.
 
1
 
will
 
be
 
with
 
inverted
 
stereo
 
(L
 
becomes
 
R,
 
R
 
become
 
L).
 
1
 
will
 
be
 
with
 
phase
 
inverted
 
and
 
then
 
results
 
are
 
averaged
 
for
 
final
 
output.
 
It
 
gives
 
a
 
little
 
better
 
SDR
 
score,
 
but
 
hard
 
to
 
tell
 
if
 
it's
 
really
 
audible
 
in
 
most
 
cases”
  “overlap:  This  helps  improve  separation  quality  slightly.  Higher  overlap  might  give  better  
results
 
at
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
slower
 
processing
 
speeds.”
 
I'll
 
go
 
for
 
8.
 
For
 
instrumentals,
 
oeverlap
 
higher
 
than
  “chunk_size:  Just  leave  it  default  unless  the  model  uses  higher  chunk_size  in  yaml  (the  
Colab
 
overrides
 
the
 
parameter).
 
 Sometimes  it  might  fail  to  detect  files  uploaded  on  GDrive  after  mounting  on  Colab  was  
done.
 
Then
 
open
 
file
 
manager
 
in
 
the
 
Colab
 
and
 
show
 
your
 
input
 
folder,
 
so
 
your
 
file
 
will
 
appear
 
and
 
start
 
working.
 
Sometimes
 
adding
 
a
 
new
 
code
 
field
 
with:
 
drive.mount("/content/drive",
 
force_remount=True)
 will  be  necessary  (it  forces  remounting).   Colab  instruction  for  newbies   0.  If  you  plan  to  use  your  GDrive  for  input  files,  go  there  now,  and  create  a  folder  called  
“input”
 
and
 
upload
 
your
 
files
 
there.
 
Create
 
also
 
"output"
 
folder
 
in
 
the
 
root
 
GDrive
 
directory
 
(not
 
sure
 
if
 
the
 
Colab
 
creates
 
both
 
already).
 
That
 
way
 
you
 
may
 
decrease
 
the
 
time
 
till
 
timeout,
 
when
 
the
 
Colab
 
is
 
initialized
 
(esp.
 
for
 
people
 
with
 
slower
 
connection),
 
and
 
also
 
you
 
will
 
avoid
 
an
 
occasional
 
bug
 
when
 
files
 
uploaded
 
on
 
GDrive
 
appear
 
with
 
some
 
delay
 
in
 
the
 
Colab.
 The  Colab  is  case  aware  -  e.g.  call  your  folder  "input"  not  "Input"  to  match  what  is  written  in  
the
 
Colab
