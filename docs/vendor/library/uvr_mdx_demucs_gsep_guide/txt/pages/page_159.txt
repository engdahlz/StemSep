    “Some  people  don't  realize  that  if  you  want  something  to  sound  as  clean  as  possible,  you'll  
have
 
to
 
work
 
for
 
it.
 
Making
 
an
 
instrumental/acapella
 
sounding
 
good
 
takes
 
time
 
and
 
effort.
 
It's
 
not
 
something
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
rushed.
 
Think
 
of
 
it
 
like
 
(...)
 
love
 
to
 
a
 
woman.
 
You
 
wouldn't
 
want
 
to
 
just
 
rush
 
through
 
it,
 
would
 
you?
 
Running
 
your
 
song
 
through
 
different
 
models/algorithms,
 
then
 
manually
 
filtering,
 
EQing,
 
noise/bleed
 
removing
 
the
 
rest
 
is
 
a
 
start.
 
You
 
can't
 
just
 
run
 
a
 
song
 
through
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
models
 
and
 
expect
 
it
 
to
 
immediately
 
sound
 
like
 
this”

Sometimes
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
combine
 
results
 
of
 
specific
 
models
 
in
 
specific
 
song
 
fragments.
 If  the  song  is  too  muddy,  you  might  want  to  use  demudder  in  newer UVR  patches  and/or  use  some  free  AIs like  AudioSR,  Apollo  or  other,  to  further  enhance  the  result.  If  you’re  still  not  happy,  you  might  want  to  manually  mix  separated  song  stems  and/or  master  it  using  plugins  or  AI  mastering  services  (more  about  it  here).   Sometimes  you  might  be  capable  of  creating  a  loop  out  of  the  fade  ins/outs/intros/outros  so  
you
 
could
 
totally
 
refrain
 
from
 
using
 
AI
 
separation
 
in
 
the
 
key
 
fragments
 
of
 
the
 
song,
 
so
 
you
 
could
 
just
 
only
 
use
 
AI
 
as
 
reference
 
to
 
arrange
 
the
 
song
 
as
 
it
 
was,
 
and
 
only
 
fill
 
missing
 
fragments
 
with
 
separation.
  A  good  starting  point  is  to  have  a  lossless  song (the  result  will  be  a  bit  less  muddy  after  separation).    Now,  from  free  separation  AIs/models,  to  get  a  decent  instrumental/vocals,  you  can  use  the  
solutions
 
below,
 
starting
 
from
 
the
 
models
 
at
 
top
 
(every
 
song
 
might
 
work
 
differently
 
with
 
different
 
models
 
-
 
find
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
your
 
song
 
-
 
also,
 
various
 
headphones
 
and
 
speakers
 
might
 
be
 
more
 
or
 
less
 
sensitive
 
to
 
show
 
you
 
bleeding
 
in
 
song
 
-
 
lots
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
imminent
 
without
 
phase

in
 
songs
