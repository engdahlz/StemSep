    Comparing  the  results  from  multiple  models,  I  find  that  Chunks  enabled  on  MDX  and  
Demucs
 
removes
 
some
 
bleeding
 
vocals
 
from
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
track
 
and
 
gives
 
better
 
results
 
overall.
 
This
 
ensemble
 
in
 
my
 
machine
 
completes
 
in
 
about
 
5
 
min
 
per
 
song
 
(GTX
 
1070
 
8GB,
 
16GB
 
RAM,

1600x).

  ____________   -  “The  best  combo  is  the  HQ  instrument  models  ensemble  average/average  including  
HQ3/Main/Main
 
Inst/Kim1/2/Kim
 
Inst/demucs3
 
(mdx_extra)/htdemucs_ft/hdtdemucs6s”

  "Wow,  I  tried  out  the  ensemble  with  all  those  models  you  said,  and  it  actually  sounds  pretty  
good.
 
There's
 
a
 
definitely
 
more
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
but
 
in
 
a
 
saturated/detailed
 
distortion
 
type
 
of
 
way.
 
I
 
can't
 
tell
 
which
 
one
 
I
 
like
 
better,
 
the
 
ensemble
 
sounds
 
more
 
full
 
and
 
has
 
more
 
detailed
 
frequencies,
 
but
 
the
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
more
 
obvious.
 
The
 
HQ_3
 
by
 
itself
 
has
 
almost
 
no
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
but
 
sounds
 
more
 
thin
 
and
 
watery."
  -  Kim  instr  +  mdx  net  instr3  +  HQ2  +  HQ3  +  voc  ft  max/max  The  result  is  so  amazing…  Now  can  hear  more  detail  on  instrumental  result  where  before  I  
cannot
 
hear
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
music
 
parts.

  -  "I  am  very  much  enjoying  making  an  ensemble  of  HQ3  and  MDX23C_D1581,  then  
inverting
 
the
 
vocals
 
into
 
the
 
instrumental
 
and
 
running
 
that
 
through
 
hq3
 
with
 
0.5
 
overlap"
