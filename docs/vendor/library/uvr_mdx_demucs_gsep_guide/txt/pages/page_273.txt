    (https://sergree.github.io/matchering/)  -  Available  on  UVR  [You  can  also  try  out  https://masterknecht.klangknecht.com/]   General  workflow:       1.  (Optional)  Pre-process  low-quality  audio  with  FlashSR.  2.  Train  RVC  on  clean  studio  stems.  3.  Run  inference  on  the  old  stems  with  the  trained  model  (i.e.,  feed  the  cleaned  original  vocal  
through
 
the
 
trained
 
RVC
 
model
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
converted
 
stem.)
 4.  Blend,  align  and  mix  original  +  RVC  stem  (RVC  as  enhancement,  not  replacement)  until  it  
feels
 
natural.
 5.  Use  Matchering  or  other  mastering  techniques  to  polish.   For  comprehensive  remastering  workflow,  see  How  to  make  your  own  remaster.   The  overall  takeaway:  RVC  can  be  used  for  restoration,  but  it  works  best  as  part  of  a  chain  
of
 
tools
 
(super-resolution,
 
EQ
 
matching,
 
mastering),
 
with
 
the
 
human
 
performance
 
always
 
kept
 
at
 
the
 
center
 
through
 
blending
 
rather
 
than
 
full
 
replacement.”

  (Instruction  moved  to  Reading  advice)   Older  models  descriptions   -  Inst  fullband  (fb)  HQ_3/4/5  x-minus,  MVSEP,  Colabs   HQ_4  vs  3  has  some  problems  with  fadeouts  when  occasionally  it  can  leave  some  vocal  
residues
  HQ_3  generally  has  problems  with  strings.  mdx_extra  from  Demucs  3/4  had  better  result  
with
 
strings

compensation
 
in
 
ensemble
 
for
 
these
 
lost
 
instruments,
 
but
 
HQ_3
 
gives
 
some
 
extra
 
details
 
compared
 
to
 
those.
  HQ_3/4  are  generally  muddy  models  at  times,  but  with  not  much  of  vocal  residues  (near  
Gsep
 
at
 
times,
 
but
 
more
 
than
 
BS-Roformer
 
v2).
 For  more  clarity,  use  MDX23C  HQ  model  (HQ_2  can  have  less  vocal  residues  at  times).   Another  possibly  problematic  instruments  are  those  wind  ones  (flute,  trumpet  etc.)
