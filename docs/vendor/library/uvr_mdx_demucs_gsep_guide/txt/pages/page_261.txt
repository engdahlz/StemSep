    “What's  crazy  is  maximum  aggressiveness  sometimes  does  better  at  removing  bgvox  than  
actual
 
karaoke
 
models”
  Denoising  (vinyl  noise/white  noise/general)  -  Denoise  standard  in  UVR  for  MDX  noise  (like  in  HQ_1-5,  iirc  it  uses  HV  code;  explanation  how  it  works:  it  separates  "twice,  with  the  second  try  inverted,  after  separation  reinverted,  to  
amplify
 
the
 
result,
 
but
 
remove
 
the
 
noise
 
introduced
 
by
 
MDX,
 
and
 
then
 
deamplified
 
by
 
6dB,
 
so
 
it
 
still
 
the
 
same
 
volume,
 
just
 
without
 
MDX
 
noise.”
 -  Denoise  model  in  UVR  (it’s  using  VR’s  UVR-DeNoise-Lite,  20kHz  cutoff)  (Options>Choose  Advanced  Menu>Advanced  MDX-Net  Options>Denoise  output)   for  filtering  noise  existing  in  almost  all  MDX-Net  models  in  silent  or  quiet  parts,  but  potentially  
also
 
for
 
more
 
applications

 Filters  more  MDX  noise  in  quieter  parts  than  denoise  standard  and  denoise  model.   -  Mel-Roformer  Denoise  by  Aufr33  |  Colab |  MVSEP  |  links  below  a)  minimum  aggressiveness  model  called  “27.9959”  a.k.a.  “1”   -  good  for  white  noise/static  noise  b)  average  “27.9768”  a.k.a.  “2”  model   
-
 
works
 
for
 
footsteps,
 
crunches,
 
rustling,
 
sound
 
of
 
cars,
 
helicopters
 Some  people  like  to  use  overlap  10  with  these  models.   
minimum
 
-
 
removes
 
fewer
 
effects
 
such
 
as
 
thunder
 
rolls,
 
scratching
 
or
 
sweeping
 
surfaces.
 
It’s
 
not
 
as
 
good
 
at
 
removing
 
louder
 
MDX
 
noise

of

older

UVR
  average  a.k.a.  aggressive  -  usually  removes  more  noise  than  minimum,  and  also  
occasionally

  “The  Mel-RoFormer  denoise  model  is  amazing  at  removing  78  RPM  record  crackle”  It’s  much  better  at  higher  frequencies  than  the  model  below  (it  doesn’t  damage  them  that  
bad).
 
 Incredibly  useful  as  mixing  tools,  can  pull  all  kinds  of  hum  out  of  raw  vocals,  guitars,  room  
mic's,
 
bass,
 
etc
 
before
 
mixing
 
with
 
zero
 
artifacts
 
left
 
over.
 
I
 
would
 
absolutely
 
love
 
to
 
see
 
where
 
he
 
takes
 
these.

In
