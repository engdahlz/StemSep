you
 can  use  later  to  check  the  result  manually  for  manual  weighted  ensemble e.g.  in  DAW  or  in  Colab).

VR  Colab  by  HV   (old)  https://colab.research.google.com/github/NaJeongMo/Colaboratory-Notebook-for-Ultimate-Vocal-Remover/blob/main/Vocal%20Remover%205_arch.ipynb   Use  this fixed  notebook  for  now  (04.04.23)  Sometimes  Google  Colab  might  break  itself  (e.g.  error:  No  module  named  'pathvalidate'),  
and
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
simply
 
try
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
Environment
 
and
 
delete
 
it
 
entirely
 
and
 
start
 
over,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
might
 
start
 
working.
  (since  17.03.23  the  official  link  above  for  HV  Colab  stopped  working  (librosa,  and  later  
pysound
 
related
 
issues
 
with
 
again
 
YT
 
links,
 
but
 
somehow
 
fixed)
 
“!pip
 
install
 
librosa==0.9.1”
 
in
 
OG
 
Colab
 
fixes
 
the
 
issue
 
and
 
is
 
only
 
necessary
 
for
 
both
 
YT
 
and
 
local
 
files
 
and
 
clean
 
installation
 
works
 
too.)
  -  HV  also  made  a  new VR  Colab  which  irc,  now  don’t  clutter  all  your  GDrive,  but  only  downloads  models  which  you  use  (but  without  VR  ensemble)  and  probably  might  work  
without
 
GDrive
 
mounting.
  (Google  Colab  in  general  allows  separating  on  free  virtual  machine  with  decent  Nvidia  GPUs  
-
 
it's
 
for
 
all
 
those
 
who
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
their
 
personal
 
computer
 
for
 
such
 
GPU/CPU-intensive
 
tasks,
 
or
 
don’t
 
have
 
Nvidia
 
GPU
 
or
 
decent
 
CPU,
 
or
 
you
 
don’t
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
online
 
services
 
-
 
e.g.
 
frequently
 
wait
 
in
 
queues,
 
etc.)
