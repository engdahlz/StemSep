    TL;DR  “You  can  process  a  song  with  multiple  models,  and  process  multiple  songs”   -  Sucial  released  v1/2  de-breath  VR  models:  https://huggingface.co/Sucial/De-Breathe-Models/tree/main Alternatively,  for  this  purpose  you  can  also  try  out  free/abandonware:  https://archive.org/details/accusonus-era-bundle-v-6.2.00  -  (x-minus/uvronline)  Aufr33  added  new  Lead  and  Backing  vocal  separator.  It  uses  big  beta  5e  model  as  preprocessor  for  becruily  Mel  Karaoke  model   “In  fact,  the  big  
beta
 
5e
 
model
 
is
 
run
 
after
 
becruily
 
Mel
 
Karaoke”
 
Aufr33
 
(so
 
you
 
don’t
 
need
 
the
 
additional
 
step
 
to
 
use
 
this
 
separator),
 
plus
 
it
 
also
 
allows
 
controlling
 
option
 
for
 
lead
 
vocal
 
panning
 
like
 
for
 
BVE
 
v2
 
(it’s
 
to
 
“to
 
"tell"
 
the
 
AI
 
  where
 
the
 
main
 
vocals
 
are
 
located
 
(how
 
they
 
are
 
mixed).”.
 
Becruily’s
 
model
 
“doesn't
 
even
 
need
 
Lead
 
vocal
 
panning
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
time,
 
[the]
 
ability
 
to
 
recognize
 
what
 
is
 
LV
 
and
 
what
 
is
 
BV
 
[is]
 
impressive”
 
-

 The  difference  from  using  single  becruily  Kar  model  (without  preprocessor)  is  that,  here,  “you  
get
 
the
 
third
 
track,
 
backing
 
vocals.”.
  “The  new  separator  is  available  in  the  free  version,  however,  due  to  its  resource  intensity,  
only
 
the
 
first
 
minute
 
of
 
the
 
song
 
will
 
be
 
processed.”
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
premium.
  Becruily:  “Probably  too  resource-intensive,  but  you  could  try  adding  demudders  to  each  step  1)  karaoke  model  +  demudding  2)  separate  vocals  of  bgv  +  demudidng   But  not  sure  how  much  noise  this  will  bring  (Or  even  a  50:50  ensemble  with  BVE  OG)”   -  Unwa  released  Revive  2 variant  of  his  BS-Roformer  fine-tune  of  viperx  1297  model  Voc.  bleedless:  40.07,  fullness:  15.13,  SDR:  10.97  “has  a  Bleedless  score  that  surpasses  the  FT2  Bleedless”  and  fullness  lower  by  0.64.  “can  keep  the  string  well”  better  than  viperx  1297  (...)  in  my  country  they  have  some  song  
with
 
Ethnic
 
instruments.
 
Only
 
1297
 
and
 
Revive2
 
can
 
keep
 
them
 
in
 
Instrumental
 
while
 
other
 
model
 
notice
 
them
 
as
 
Vocal”
 
~daylight
 “it  does  capture  more  than  viperx's”  -  mesk  It’s  depth  12  and  dim  512,  so  the  inference  is  much  slower  than  with  some  newer  
Mel-Roformers
 
like
 
voc_fv4
 
(even
 
two
 
times),
 
with
 
the
 
exception
 
of
 
Mel
 
1143
 
which
 
is
 
as
 
slow
 
as
 
BS
 
1297
 
(thx
 
dca,
 
neoculture).
  -  BS-Roformer  Revive  unwa’s  vocal  model (viperx  1297  model  fine-tuned)  was  released.  Voc.  bleedless:  38.80,  fullness:  15.48,  SDR:  11.03  “Less  instrument  bleed  in  vocal  track  compared  to  BS  1296/1297”  but  it  still  has  many  issues,  “has  fewer  problems  with  instruments  bleeding  it  seems  compared  to  Mel.  (...)  1297  had  very  few  instrument  bleeding  in  vocal,  and  that  Revive  model  is  even  better  at  this
