    Don’t  replace  models.py  from  packages  with  models  from  here now.  Now  denoiser  optionally  added!   -  MDX  Colab  with  newer  models  is  now  reworked  to  use  with  current  Python  3.10  runtime  
which
 
all
 
Colabs
 
now
 
use.
 
  -  Since  28.04  lots  of  Colabs  started  having  errors  like  "onnxruntime  module  not  found".  
Probably
 
only
 
MDX
 
Colab
 
(was)
 
affected.
 (not  needed  anymore)  >  "As  a  temp  workaround  you  can  go  to  "Tools"  in  the  main  menu,  and  "Command  Palette",  
and
 
search
 
for
 
"Use
 
fallback
 
runtime
 
version",
 
and
 
click
 
on
 
it,
 
this
 
will
 
restart
 
the
 
notebook
 
with
 
the
 
previous
 
python
 
version,
 
and
 
things
 
should
 
works
 
as
 
they
 
were
 
before"
  -  OG MDX  HV  Colab  is  (also)  broken  due  to  torch  related  issues  (reported  to  HV).  To  fix  it,  add  new  code  row  with:  !pip  install  torch==1.13.1   below  mounting  and  execute  it  after  mounting    >  or  use  fixed  MDX  Colab with  newer  models  and  fix  added  (now  with  also  old  Karaoke  models).   -  While  using  OG HV  VR  Colab,  people  are  currently  encountering  issues  related  to  librosa .  The  issues  are  already  reported  to  HV  (the  author  of  the  Colab).    >   use  this  fixed VR  Colab  for  now  (04.04.23).  (the  issue  itself  was  fixed  by  uncommenting  librosa  line  and  setting  0.9.1  version   -   deleted  "#"  before  the  lines  in  Mount  to  Drive  cell,  
now

fresh

issues
 
are
 
fixed
 
-
 
probably
 
the
 
previous
 
fix
 
was
 
based
 
on
 
too
 
old
 
HV
 
Colab
 
revision).
 
VR
 
Colab
 
is
 
not
 
affected
 
by

  -  If  you  have  fast  CPU,  consider  using  it  for  ensemble  if  you  have  only  4GB  VRAM,  
otherwise
 
you
 
can
 
encounter
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
instrumentals.
 
11GB
 
VRAM
 
is
 
good
 
enough,
 
maybe
 
even
 
8GB.
