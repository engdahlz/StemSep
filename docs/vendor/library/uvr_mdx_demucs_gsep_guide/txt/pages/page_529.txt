    I  should've  calculated  it  prior,  what  the  better  subscription  was,  the  10GB  or  20GB  a  day  one  
vs.
 
price
 
vs.
 
content
 
approx.
 
in
 
total.
 52mb  (wav)  *  12  (multitracks)  =  624mb  per  song  4.766  songs  *  624  =  2973984  mb  =  2.97tb  weekly  limit  =  70gb  *  4  (weeks)  =  280gb  =  280000mb  2973984  /  280000  =  10,6  weeks  in  total.  10,6  /  4  =  2,65  so  3  months  x  $30  =  90  bucks”   https://www.epidemicsound.com/music/search/ Can  be  ripped.  Some  tracks  there  will  be  a  subject  to  rule  out  due  to  bleeding.  Plenty  of  
genres.
 
Might
 
be
 
good
 
for

 (jarredou  have  it)    Vocals/speech    MedleyVox  dataset  (for  separating  different  singers)  of  which  they  refrain  from  releasing  the  
model
 
for
 
(and
 
Cyrus
 
eventually
 
did
 
it
 
single-handedly):
 https://github.com/CBeast25/MedleyVox (13  different  singing  datasets  of  400  hours  and  460  hours  of  LibriSpeech  data  for  training)  https://zenodo.org/record/7984549 k_multisinger:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/18evyY82ec4IdNT2z8q76zm30EWhfc-9j/view?usp=sharing k_multitimbre  /  K_multitembre:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ic4P8gCGwbLshR118N8V3tbAU-D9Us-i/view?usp=sharing Potentially  more  here:  https://sites.google.com/site/shinnosuketakamichi/home  Be  aware  that  the  only  one  MedleyVox  dataset  which  remains  unobtainable  to  this  day  is  
TONAS,
 
but
 
it’s
 
small,
 
esp.
 
compare
 
to
 
the
 
Korean
 
datasets.
 
Besides
 
this
 
one,
 
queer
 
and
 
Cyrus
 
have
 
them
 
all
 
on
 
our
 
Discord,
 
but
 
they’re
 
huge.
 
Ksinger
 
and
 
Ktimbre
 
takes
 
~300GB
 
unzipped
 
for
 
both.
