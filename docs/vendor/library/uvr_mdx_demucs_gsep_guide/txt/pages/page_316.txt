    beta  4  -  25.93  FullnessVocalModel  -  25.91  voc_fv4  -  25.02    Other  ensembles  for  UVR5   Best  newer  ensembles  on  the  list  at  the  top of  the  doc.  Older  configurations  follow  after  the  listed  hidden  results  below.  For  reference,  read  MVSEP’s  SDR  evaluation  chart (UVR  ensembles  will  appear  later  in  the  chart).   Be  aware  that  some  of  the  results  on  the  chart  above  at  the  top  are  not  from  UVR5  or  use  
different
 
methods
 
and
 
code
 
to
 
achieve
 
better
 
results
 
and
 
might
 
be

  Hidden  leaderboard  results  (all  SDR  results  provided  for  instrumentals,  
Discord
 
links

are
 
dead,
 
but
 
at
 
least
 
some
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
by
 
the

  -  Bas’  unreleased  fullband  vocal  model  epoch  299  +  voc_ft  -  SDR  16.32)  -  this older  viperx’  unreleased  custom  weights  code  (newer  one  is  up  already),  besides,  “instrumental  vX”  entries  are  his  ones  (it  rather  utilizes  public  models  with  his  own  non-public  
weighted
 
inference,
 
and
 
he
 
gatekeeps
 
it
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
since
 
MDX23
 
results
 
were
 
published).
 
 BTW.  ebright  is  probably  the  2nd  place  in  MDX23,  at  least  the  result  appeared  in  similar  time  
like
 
ByteDance.
 
2nd
 
place
 
decided
 
not
 
to
 
publish
 
their
 
work.
 -  32-bit higher  SDR  result  of  original  multisong  dataset  uploaded  as  output  (opposed  to  the  previous  16-bit  currently  on  top).  “Multisong  dataset  |  Original  stems  |  bass/drums/other  
joined”
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
model!
  -  Bytedance  v.0.2  -  inst.  SDR  17.26,  now  it’s  outperformed  by  v.0.3  and  is  17.28,  now  called  1.0),   -"MSS"  -  is  probably  ByteDance  2.0,  not  multi  source  stable  diffusion,  as  BD's  test  files  which  were  published  were  starting  with  MSS  name  before,  but  the  first  doesn't  necessarily  contradict  the  latter,  although  they  said  to  use  novel  arch  -  SDR  18.13,  and  probably  another  one  by  ByteDance  -  SDR  18.75,  let's  call  it  2.1,  but  seeing  inconsistent  vocal  result  vs  previous  one  here,  we  have  some  suspicions  that  the  result  was  manipulated  at  least  for  
vocals
 
(or
 
stems
 
were
 
given
 
from
 
different
 
model).
 
 -  Ripple  app/SAMI-Bytedance  on  the  chart  is  16.59,  also  input  files  weren't  lossless.  -  BS-Roformer  results  by  viperx  posted  in  Training  BTW.  model_mel_band_roformer_ep_617_sdr_11.5882  is  Bas  Curtiz  model  trained  purely  
on
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
as
 
an
 
experiment,
 
and
 
won’t
 
give
 
good
 
results
 
outside
 
multisong
 
dataset.
