    In  the  end  of  the  day,  source  separation  is  prediction.  It's  predicting  where  it  thinks  it  is,  but  
there
 
will
 
be
 
always
 
some
 
imperfections,
 
e.g.
 
whenever
 
you
 
hear
 
muddier
 
sound
 
in
 
a
 
track
 
which
 
has
 
more
 
noise
 
like
 
metal
 
tracks.
  Anjok  emphasizes  on  (currently)  lack  of  correlation  between  SDR  and  the  fact  that  bigger  
SDR
 
metric
 
doesn’t
 
necessarily
 
mean
 
better.
 
He
 
tried
 
some
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
SDR
 
chart
 
result
 
before,
 
and
 
wasn’t
 
quite
 
happy
 
about
 
them.
  Because  phase  is  a  big  part  of  the  issue,  now  the  new  upcoming  -   Demudder  A  UVR  feature  incoming  (it  was  also  explained  before  on  the  server  by  Anjok  -  if  something  
is
 
not
 
clear,
 
try
 
to
 
find
 
his
 
messages
 
there)
  It  uses  lots  of  phasing  tricks.  It  processes  the  track  twice.  The  first  takes  instrumental  from  
the
 
first
 
go
 
around
 
and
 
compares
 
it
 
against
 
the
 
original
 
mixture.
 
It
 
chops
 
the
 
mixture
 
into
 
3
 
seconds
 
chunks
 
and
 
?inerts
 
over
 
that
 
lists
 
of
 
chunks
 
and
 
for
 
each
 
segment,
 
it
 
cuts
 
out
 
where
 
that
 
segment
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
instrumental,
 
and
 
it
 
finds
 
similar
 
events
 
that
 
aren't
 
at
 
the
 
exact
 
same
 
place.
 
It
 
takes
 
those
 
chunks,
 
and
 
it
 
analyses
 
them
 
against
 
the
 
instrumental
 
that
 
was
 
generated,
 
and
 
it
 
tries
 
to
 
find
 
the
 
most
 
similar
 
events
 
it
 
can
 
from
 
the
 
instrumental,
 
that
 
aren't
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
place
 
from
 
that
 
segment,
 
and
 
it
 
finds
 
similar
 
events,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
phases
 
it,
 
it
 
does
 
a
 
phase
 
invert
 
of
 
that
 
instrumental
 
 (56:30)  If  the  volume  or  DB  threshold  isn't  past  the  certain  point  because  it's  too  loud  then  it  
means
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
cancel
 
out
 
and
 
doesn't
 
make
 
phase
 
invert,
 
if
 
it
 
reaches
 
a
 
certain
 
threshold
 
like
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
below
 
certain
 
threshold
 
it'll
 
phase
 
that,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
will
 
basically
 
stitch
 
together
 
a
 
new
 
mixture
 
that
 
is
 
kind
 
of
 
phased
 
from
 
that
 
original
 
instrumental
 
output,
 
and
 
it
 
reprocesses
 
that
 
new
 
stitch
 
together,
 
mixture
 
with
 
the
 
phase
 
with
 
the
 
instrumental
 
phase
 
changed,
 
and
 
it
 
processes
 
that
 
through
 
the
 
second
 
pass,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
takes
 
that
 
vocal
 
and
 
then
 
phase
 
inverts
 
it
 
with
 
the
 
mixture,
 
with
 
the
 
original
 
mixture
 
and
 
then
 
what
 
you
 
end
 
up
 
having
 
is
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
parts
 
that
 
are
 
similar
 
from
 
the
 
other
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
track,
 
you
 
end
 
up
 
having
 
those
 
fill
 
in
 
the
 
spectral
 
holes.
 Sam  remarks  find  some  similarity  with  probably  how  Izotope  Imager  works.  Anjok  says:  I'm  trying  to  get  a  similar  part,  but  also  try  to  take  it  and  phase  it  with  that  
segment.
 
Because
 
it's
 
not
 
the
 
exact
 
same
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
segment,
 
it's
 
not
 
gonna
 
be
 
a
 
perfect
 
phase,
 
because
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
an
 
original
 
vocal
 
output.
 So  it's  kind  of  still  finding  the  bit  of  instrumental  that  is  still  in  the  vocal.   Sam  remarks  about  frequent  situations  where  you  perform  separation,  and  it  can  lead  to  
decrease
 
of
 
e.g.
 
hihat
 
volume
 
levels
 
in
 
instrumental,
 
referring
 
to
 
what
 
information
 
separated
 
vocal
 
stem
 
can
 
wear.
 
It's
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
muddiness
 
Anjok
 
tried
 
to
 
address
 
with
 
the
 
feature.
 Anjok  didn't  want  to  compromise  vocal  quality,  and  in  some  cases  it  makes  vocal  better  too,  
but
 
it
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
how
 
the
 
track
 
was
 
mixed
 
originally.
 
If
 
it's
 
analog
 
track
 
recorded
 
in
 
one
 
session
 
or
 
even
 
live
 
track,
 
it
 
won't
 
work
 
so
 
good.
 
The
 
problem
 
is
 
with
 
e.g.
 
10
 
minutes
 
track,
