    -  chunk_size  =  500000  will  fail  with  5:30  track,  decrease  it  to  at  least  300K  in  such  case.  Overlap  0.8  is  a  good  balance  between  duration  and  quality.  -  In  case  of  system  error  wav  not  found,  simply  retry  separation.  Nice  instruction how  to  use  the  Colab.  The  v.  2.1  Colab  was  firstly  evaluated  with  lower  parameters,  hence  it  received  slightly  worse  
SDR.
 
Then
 
it
 
was
 
evaluated
 
again
 
and
 
got
 
better
 
score
 
than
 
v2.
  WiP  Colabs  -  2.2  Beta  1 (no  voc_ft  yet)  -  2.2  Beta  1.5 -  2.2  Beta  (1.5.1,  inference with  voc_ft,  replace  in  the  Colab  above;  no  fine-tuning)  -  v2.2 beta  2/3  (working  inference)  (MDX  bigshifts,  overlap  added,  fine-tuning,  no  4  stems  >  experimental,  no  support  for  now,  22  minutes  for  vocals  only,  mdx:  bsf  21,  ov  0.15,  500k,

track)
 -  v2.2 (w/  voc_ft  inference)  pre  beta  3  w/o  MDX  v3  yet  -  comment  out  both  bigshifts  in  the  cell  -  they  won’t  work   -  current  beta  link (WiP,  might  be  unstable  at  times;  e.g.  here  for  19.07  bigshifts  doesn’t  work,  and  you  need  to  look  for  working  inference  in  history  or  delete  the  two  bigshifts

  In  general  -   MDX23  is  quite  an  improvement  over  htdemucs_ft  (...).  Drum  stem  makes  htdemucs_ft  sound  like  lossy  in  comparison,  absolutely  beautiful  Bass  is  significantly  more  accurate,  identifies  and  retains  actual  bass  guitar  frequencies  with  
clarity
 
and
 
accuracy
 "Other",  equally  impressive  improvement  over  htdemucs_ft,  much  more  clarity  in  guitars"  And  problems  with  vocals  they  originally  described  are  probably  fixed  in  V2  Colab.   -  “I  just  added  2  new  denoise  models  that  were  made  by  FoxJoy.  They  are  both  very  good  at  
removing
 
any
 
residual
 
noise
 
left

  -  New  MDX-UVR  “HQ_3”  model  released  in  UVR5  GUI!  The  best  SDR  for  a  single  instrumental  model  so  far.  Model  file (but  visiting  download  center  is  enough).  On  X-Minus  I  think  too.
