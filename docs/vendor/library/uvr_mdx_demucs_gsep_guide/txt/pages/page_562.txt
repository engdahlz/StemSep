    GPU  handling  “I’ve  reduced  mine's  core  clock  down  to  60%  with  barely  any  reduction  in  performance,  but  
it’s
 
much
 
cooler
 
now

about
 
55
 
degrees

 Bad  thermal  paste  (e.g.  MX-2)  can  dry  out  in  a  year  in  high  temperatures  up  to  80  degrees.  
Some
 
GPU
 
brands
 
allow
 
changing
 
thermal
 
paste
 
before
 
warranty
 
period
 
ends.
 Consider  a  PC  case  with  good  airflow.  Thermal  pads  might  degrade  after  5  years  or  when  
you
 
disassemble
 
them
 
and,
 
in
 
a
 
result,
 
increase
 
temperatures
 
for
 
memory.
 
Then,
 
check
 
specific
 
pad
 
density
 
for
 
your
 
model
 
and
 
replace
 
it.
 
You
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
monitor
 
VRAM
 
temperature
 
in
 
e.g.
 
GPU-Z.
 
Sometimes
 
it
 
can
 
be

state
 
even
 
longer.
   PyTorch  supporting  ROCm  on  Windows  natively  without  WSL  was  unavailable  before  (old  documentation),  and  for  consumer  GPUs  is  now  supported  with  ROCm  6.4.4  for  only  RX  7000/9000.   Seeing  by  e.g.  Stable  Diffusion  WebUI,  any  potential  DirectML  forks  will  be  much  slower  than  ROCm  (src),  so  for  now,  ROCm  is  the  only  reasonable  way  to  go  on  Radeons  (probably  ZLUDA  forks  are  still  too  much  behind  in  development  to  be  any  useful  (for  now  official  repo  supports  only  Geekbench,  and  further  maintained  fork of  the  old  base  doesn’t  work  with  e.g.  UVR  [or  we  just  haven’t  tried  hard  enough  yet]).   Unwa:  “The  transition  from  GeForce  to  Radeon  was  not  too  difficult.  It  may  be  a  bit  cumbersome  to  build  the  environment.”  “So  far  I  have  not  had  any  problems.  Running  the  same  thing  appears  to  use  a  little  more  
VRAM
 
than
 
when
 
running
 
on
 
the
 
NVIDIA
 
GPU,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
problem
 
since
 
my
 
budget
 
is
 
not
 
that
 
large
 
and
 
if
 
I
 
choose
 
NVIDIA
 
I
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
16GB
 
of
 
VRAM
 
(4070
 
Ti
 
S/4080
 
S).
 Processing  speeds  are  also  noticeably  faster,  but  I  did  not  record  the  results  on  the  previous  
GPU,
 
so
 
I
 
can't
 
compare
 
them
 
exactly.“
  MDX-Net  v2  (not  incl.  above,  see  Kim’s  MDX-Net  v2  training  repo  here)  -  lighter  and  older  arch  than  Roformers,  less  effective  and  aggressive,  less  filtered  Turned  out  to  be  easier  in  picking  out  proper  parameters  for  training  than  VR.  In  case  of  e.g.  MDX-Net,  you  take  under  consideration  how  big  your  model  is  intended  to  be  
by
 
fft
 
parameter
 
determining
 
the
 
cutoff
 
of
 
the
 
model,
 
and
 
also
 
in-out
 
channels
 
(size
 
of
 
the
 
channels
 
long
 
story
 
short)
 
-
 
it
 
increases
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
and
 
intensifies
 
the
 
resources
 
needed
 
for
 
training.
 So  if  you  have  a  smaller  dataset,  your  model  doesn’t  have  to  be  that  large.  If  you  crank  up  the  model  size  too  much  for  a  small  dataset,  you're  putting  yourself  into  a  risk  
of
 
overfitting.
 
It
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
model
 
will
 
work
 
too
 
well
 
on
 
a
 
data
 
which
 
was
 
trained
 
on,
 
but
 
it
 
will
 
not
 
work
 
so
 
well
 
on
 
unknown
 
songs
 
which
 
the
 
model
 
wasn’t
 
trained
 
on.
 In  case  of  situation  of  having  large  database  with  small  model  size,  there  won’t  be  much  
training
 
at
 
all.
 
It
 
will
 
basically
 
forget
 
features
 
of
 
larger
 
dataset.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
balance
 
here.
 Batch  size  is  the  amount  of  samples  that  are  being  fed  into  the  model  as  it’s  being  trained.  
Smaller
 
batch
 
sizes
 
will
 
take
 
longer
 
to
 
learn,
 
but
 
you
 
might
 
get
 
a
 
better
 
result
 
at
 
the
 
end.
