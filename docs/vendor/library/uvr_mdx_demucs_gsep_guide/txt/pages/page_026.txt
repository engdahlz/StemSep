  -  “New  Wind  model  based  on  BS  Roformer  has  been  added  in  MVSep  Wind  (wind,  other):  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250829230056-f0bb276157-mixture.wav Results  on  quality  checker:  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/8933  It  increased  SDR  +2.5  comparing  to  previous  best  model.”  -  ZFTurbo   “this  one  does  not  disappoint.  At  least  not  with  the  stuff  I've  tried  so  far.  (...)  the  improvement  
is
 
most
 
noticeable
 
with
 
orchestral
 
music.
 
In
 
heavy
 
mixes
 
eg.
 
with
 
lots
 
of
 
strings,
 
the
 
old
 
models
 
trip
 
out.
 
[The]
 
new
 
one
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
more
 
robust.”

 “the  model  is  not  only  cleaner  but  also  detects  some  wind  instruments  that  the  previous  one  
couldn't
 
(specially
 
baritone
 
saxophones,
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
test
 
it
 
a
 
bit
 
more)”

 “the  bs  roformer  wind  model  does  really  well  with  the  other  result  and  the  violin  model  really  
is
 
quite
 
useful”

  -  Suno  now  has  stem  separation  feature  “t's  generative,  so  the  separation  isn't  exact.  Also,  
you
 
apparently
 
can't
 
use
 
it
 
on
 
like
 
famous
 
songs
 
because
 
they'll
 
get
