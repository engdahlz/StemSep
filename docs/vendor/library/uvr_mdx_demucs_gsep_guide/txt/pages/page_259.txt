"I
 
find
 
it's
 
useful
 
to
 
take
 
the

mix
 
them

a
 
nice

“Acon
 
is
 
probably
 
best
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
tweak
 
to

stem

RX
 
is
 
imo
 
too
 rough.”  Comparison -  Accentize  DeRoom  Pro  ("great"  but  expensive,  available  in  DxRevive  Pro,  now  1.1.0)

  -  Izotope  RX  <?8-10  Dialogue  De-Reverb  (RX  Editor/VST)  for  voice  and  mixtures  (more  possible  free  solutions).  Good  results  not  only  for  room  reflections,  but  also  regular  reverb  in  vocals.  It  picks  reverb  where  even  FoxyJoy's  model  fails  (“De-reverb”  and  
“Dialogue
 
de-reverb”
 
options).
 
It’s
 
destructive
 
for
 
mixing
 
raw
 
vocals,
 
but
 
can
 
just
 
work.

 -  Waves  Clarity  Vx  DeReverb  -  it  cannot  perform  de-echoing,  so  you  need  UVR  De-echo

it,

you
