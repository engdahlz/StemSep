(unwa)
 For  anime  and  RVC  “isn't  as  audibly  and  spectrally  full  as  fv4  +  can  at  times  have  flat-line  
artifact
 
at
 
the
 
very
 
top,
 
but
 
then,
 
fv4
 
can
 
sometimes
 
have
 
"crunchy"
 
noise
 
present
 
at
 
some
 
places,
 
so
 
an
 
ensemble
 
of
 
those
 
2
 
is
 
probs
 
a
 
good
 
idea

might
 
be

  -  Unwa’s  Kim  Mel-Band  Roformer  FT  vocal  model |  Colab Enhanced  both  voc  bleedless  36.75  (vs  36.95)  and  fullness  16.40  (vs  16.26)  metric for  vocals  vs  the  original  Mel  Kim  model.  SDR-wise  it’s  a  tad  lower  (10.97  vs  11.02).    Tips  for  separating  vocals   -  Separate  with  becruily  Mel  Vocal  model  and  its  instrumental  model  variant,  then  get  vocals  
from
 
the
 
vocal
 
model,
 
and
 
instrumental
 
from
 
instrumental
 
model,
 
import
 
both
 
stems
 
for
 
the
 
DAW
 
of
 
your
 
choice
 
(can
 
be
 
Audacity)
 
so
 
you’ll
 
get
 
a
 
file
 
sounding
 
like
 
original
 
file,
 
then
 
export
 
-
 
so
 
perform
 
a
 
mixdown
 
of
 
both
 
stems,
 
then
 
separate
 
it
 
with
 
vocal
 
model

dynamic
  -  You  can  consider  using  Lew  vocal  enhancer  v1  (model |  config),  v2  (model |  config)  and  added  to  the  Colab (this now  probably  works  instead),  and  it  also  can  be  used  in  the  latest  UVR  Roformer  beta.   -  Sometimes  using  EQ  stressing  vocals  properly  might  be  beneficial  for  separation  too   -  You  might  potentially  also  try  to  experiment  with  demudder  added  with  the  beta  patch  #14  
linked
 
above.
 
Normally
 
demudder
 
works
 
only
 
for
 
instrumentals,
 
but
 
when
 
you
 
switch
 
in
 
the
 
config
 
editor
 
to
 
vocal
 
stem
 
being
 
instrumental
 
and
 
in
 
reverse,
 
then
 
demudder
 
will
 
work
 
vocals.
 
If
 
your
 
model
 
have
 
“other”
 
stem
 
instead
 
of
 
“instrumental”
 
or
 
“vocal”,
 
you’ll
 
need
 
to
 
rename
 
it.
 
Demudder
 
requires
 
stem
 
labelled
 
as
 
instrumental
 
to
 
work
 
with.
