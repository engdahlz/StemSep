    it’s  wrong  process  -  make  a  dump  of  another  assistant  one  (one  of  three  most  intensive).  If

save

it’s
 
too
 
big.

  You  can  also  use  Matchering .  It  works  in  a  way  that  you  provide  a  reference  file,  and  it  tries  
to
 
match
 
the
 
sound
 
of
 
your
 
audio
 
to
 
the
 
reference
 
you
 
provided.
  Reference  file(s)  to  use    “Mastering  The  Mix”  (all-in-one  collection  of  reference  songs  in  one  file):  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqPmcVC3qvh_Mqd9vIssGUKpz3jTddPc/view?usp=sharing You  need  7zip  with  WavPack  plugin  to  extract  it.   Brown/Pink  noise:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJHKRb2SIgJZIc-J8kEDD1k4OQj_OXzp/view?usp=sharing “Try  to  use  this  as  reference  track  in  Matchering  to  get  nice  wide  stereo  and  corrected  high  
frequencies.”

  But  you  can  use  a  whole  song  of  your  choice,  or  its  short  fragment  (e.g.  instrumental  part  to  
get
 
better
 
result
 
of
 
separation)

Be  aware  that  there’s  a  length  limit  in  at  least  UVR5,  and  it’s  14:44  (or  possibly  just  15  
minutes).
 
Instead
 
of
 
hit
 
or
 
miss
 
by
 
lots
 
of
 
reference
 
files
 
in
 
one,
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
simply
 
one
 
song
 
you
 
think
 
will
 
fit
 
the
 
most
 
for
 
your
 
track.
 
You
 
can
 
even
 
further
 
split
 
it
 
to
 
a
 
smaller
