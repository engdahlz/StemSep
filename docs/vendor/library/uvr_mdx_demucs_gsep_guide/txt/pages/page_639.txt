    On  example  of  dca’s  ensemble  in  the  doc:  "0)  Unwa  BS  Roformer  Resurrection  Inst  (BS  2025.07  as  a  reference  for  phase  fix)  +  
MVSEP
 
BS
 
Roformer
 
2025.07
 
(Max
 
Spec)
  —->  the  least  vocal  crossbleeding.   Alternatively,  you  can  use  becruily  vocal  model  instead  of  2025.07  for  the  ensemble  -  “Becruily  vocal  correctly  recognize  instruments  far  better  than  the  instrumental  one”  -

  “This  would  equate  to  the  following  steps:  [guide  corrected;  didn't  give  correct  results  before;  thx  Ari/arxynr]   1.  Separate  your  mixture  using  the  Unwa  BS  Roformer  Resurrection  Inst  model.    •  Output:  inst_unwa.wav  (instrumental)  +  optional  vocal.   2.  Separate  your  mixture  using  the  MVSEP  BS  Roformer  2025.07  model.    •  Output:  inst_mvsep.wav  +  vox_mvsep.wav.  [Note:  Set  WAV  output.  Then  MVSEP  won't  turn  down  the  volume  to  accommodate  for  
clipping,

in
 
such
 
cases

  3.  Build  the  ensemble  with  UVR’s  Manual  Ensemble  mode:    4a.  Inputs  =  •  inst_unwa.wav  (from  Step  1)  •  inst_mvsep.wav  (from  Step  2)    4b.  Set  Algorithm  =  “Max  Spec.”    4c.  Click  Start  Processing   4.  Phase  fix  with  UVR’s  Phase  Swapper:    3a.  Target  Audio  =  inst_unwa+inst_mvsep  (ensembled).wav  (from  Step  3).    3b.  Reference  Audio  =  inst_mvsep.wav  (from  Step  2).    3c.  Click  Start  Processing.    3d.  Note  the  resulting  new  file  (~~~_phaseswapped.wav  or  similar).   The  resulting  file  =  your  final  instrumental  stem  (the  one  referenced  in  the  Google  Doc
