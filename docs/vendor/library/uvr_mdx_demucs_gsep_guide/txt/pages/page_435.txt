    already).  That  way  you  may  decrease  the  time  till  timeout  when  the  Colab  is  initialized  (esp.  
for
 
people
 
with
 
slower
 
connection).
  Now  open  the  Colab   1.  Click  the  “play”  button  on  the  Installation  cell  and  wait  until  it's  finished  (should  show  a  
green
 
checkmark
 
on
 
the
 
side)
  2.  Click  the  “play”  button  on  the  GDrive  cell.  It  will  ask  you  for  permission  for  this  notebook  to  access  your  Google  Drive  files,  you  can  
either
 
accept
 
or
 
deny
 
it
 
(it
 
is
 
recommended
 
to
 
accept
 
it
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
Google
 
Drive
 
as
 
i/o
 
for
 
your
 
files).
  After  you've  done  installing  it,  go  to  the  Separation  section  below.  Default  settings  are  already  balanced  in  terms  of  SDR,  and  too  resource-intensive.   3.  Click  on  the  play  button  to  start  the  Separation,  **make  sure**  you  uploaded  the  audio  file  
in
 
the
 
`folder_path`.
 After  it's  done,  it  will  output  the  stems  in  the  `output_folder`.   Also  note,  "`filename_instrum`"  is  the  inversion  of  the  separated  vocals  stems  against  the  
original
 
audio.
  "`filename_instrum2`"  when  “Separation_mode:”  is  set  to  4  stems  (slower)  is  the  sum  of  the  
Drums
 
+
 
Bass
 
+
 
Other
 
stems
 
that
 
are
 
obtained
 
by
 
processing
 
"`instrum`"
 
with
 
multiple
 
Demucs
 
models.
  So  "`instrum`"  is  the  most  untouched  and  "`instrum2`"  can  have  fewer  vocals  residues  or  
sound
 
a
 
bit
 
muddier.
  Experimenting  on  settings  you  can  set  BigShifts  to  5  or  7,  although  it  may  not  give  a  
noticeable
 
difference
 
vs
 
default
 
3,
 
while
 
increasing
 
separation
 
time
 
severely,
 
but
 
some
 
people
 
use
 
20
 
or
 
even
 
30.
   Comparisons  of  MDX23  (probably  v.  2.0)  vs  single  demucs_ft  model  by  A5   The  Beatles  -  She  Loves  You  -  2009  Remaster  (24-bit  -  44.1kHz)  So  I  tried  out  the  MDX23  Colab  with  She  Loves  You,  which  is  easily  the  most  ratty  sounding  
of
 
all
 
the
 
Beatles
 
recordings,
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
pure
 
mono
 
and
 
the
 
current
 
master
 
was
 
derived
 
from
 
a
 
clean
 
vinyl
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
single
 
circa
 
1980.
 
So
 
if
 
it
 
can
 
handle
 
that,
 
it
 
can
 
handle
 
anything.
 
And
 
well,
 
MDX23
 
is
 
very
 
nice,
 
certainly
 
on
 
par
 
with
 
htdemucs_ft,
 
and
 
maybe
 
even
 
better.
 
I'm
 
surprised.
 
You
 
can
 
hear
 
the
 
air
 
around
 
the
 
drums.
 
Something
 
that
 
is
 
relatively
 
rare
