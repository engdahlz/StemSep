    Also,  you  can  uncomment  visibility  of  compensation  value  in  Colab,  and  change  it  to  e.g.  
1.08
 
to
 
experiment.
 Compensation  value  for  464  MDX-UVR  inst.  model  is  1.0568175092136585  Default  1.03597672895  is  for  9.7  model,  and  it  also  does  the  trick  with  at  least  Kim  (old)  
model
 
in
 
GUI
 
(where
 
1.08
 
had
 
worse
 
SDR).
 Or  check  +  3.07  in  DAW  (it  worked  on  Karokee  model).   In  Collab  above,  I  also  enabled  visibility  of  max_mag  for  vocals  and  min_mag  for  
instrumentals
 
settings
 
(mixing_algoritm).
  Also,  if  you  want  to  use  Demucs  option  (ensemble)  in  Kae  Colab,  it  uses  stock  Demucs  2,  
which
 
in
 
UVR5
 
was
 
rewritten
 
to
 
use
 
Demucs-UVR
 
models
 
with
 
Demucs
 
3
 
or
 
even
 
currently
 
better
 
Demucs
 
4.
  According  to  MVSEP  SDR  measurements,  for  ensemble  Max  Spec/Min  Spec  was  better  
than
 
Min
 
Spec/Max
 
Spec,
 
but
 
Avg/Avg
 
was
 
still
 
better
 
than
 
these
 
both.
 Also  for  ensemble,  Avg/Avg  is  better  compared  to  e.g.  Max  Spec/Max  Spec  -  it's  10.84  v  
10.56
 
SDR
 
in
 
other
 
result.
  How  denoiser  work  It's  not  frequency  based,  it  processes  “the  audio  in  2  passes,  one  pass  with  inverted  phase,  
then
 
after
 
processing
 
the
 
phase
 
is
 
restored
 
on
 
that
 
pass,
 
and
 
both
 
passes
 
mixed
 
together
 
with
 
gain
 
*
 
0.5.
 
So
 
only
 
the
 
MDX
 
noise
 
is
 
phase
 
cancelling
 
itself.”
 Or  the  other  way  round:  “it's  only  processing  the  input  2  times,  one  time  normal  and  one  time  phase  inverted,  then  
phased
 
restored
 
after
 
separation,
 
so
 
when
 
both
 
passes
 
are
 
mixed
 
back
 
together
 
only
 
the
 
noise
 
in
 
attenuated.
 
There's
 
no
 
other
 
processing
 
involved”
  Denoise  serves  to  fix  so  called  MDX  noise  existing  in  all  inst/voc  MDX-NET  (v2)  models.  ______   Web  version  (32  bit  float  WAV  as  output  for  instrumentals,  just  use  MDX-B  for  single  
MDX-Net
 
models.
 It  was  9.682  MDX-UVR  model  in  2021,  but  in  the  end  of  2022  it's  probably  inst  1  judging  by  
SDR
 
(not
 
sure,
 
as
 
results
 
are
 
not
 
exactly
 
the
 
same),
 
then
 
more
 
models
 
were
 
added
 
(e.g.
 
HQ_3):
 https://mvsep.com/ Web  version  (paid  for  MDX,  lossless):  https://x-minus.pro/   In  kae  Colab,  you  can  keep  the  option  Demucs:  off  (ONNX  only),  it  may  provide  better  
results
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
even
 
with
 
the
 
old
 
MDX
 
narrowband
 
models
 
(non-HQ).
