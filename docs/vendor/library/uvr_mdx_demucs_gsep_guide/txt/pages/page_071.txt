     -  Both  duality  models  and  inst  v1/2  are  now  added  to  UVR  Beta  Roformer Download  Center  (problems  with  duality  models  in  UVR  have  been  fixed)   -  Unwa  released  v2  version  of  the  duality  model,  slightly  a  bit  better  SDR  and  fewer  residues  
(available
 
in
 
the
 
link
 
below)
 "other"  is  output  from  model  "Instrumental"  is  inverted  vocals  against  input  audio.  The  latter  has  lower  SDR  and  more  holes  in  the  spectrum.  So  using  MSST-GUI,  leave  the  checkbox  “extract  instrumental”  disabled  for  duality  models.   -  Unwa  released  a  new  inst-voc  Mel-Roformer  called  “duality”,  focused  on  both  instrumental  
and
 
vocal
 
stem.
 
 https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-InstVoc-Duality/tree/main |  Colab Vocals  sound  similar  to  beta  4  model,  instrumentals  are  deprived  of  the  noise  present  in  inst  
v1
 
model,
 
but
 
as
 
a
 
downside,
 
they
 
don't
 
sound
 
similarly
 
muddy
 
to
 
previous
 
Roformers.
 
 You  can  use  it  in  the  MSST-GUI for  ZFTurbo  script  (already  added)  or  with  the  OG  ZF  repo  code.  The  model  will  now  work  in  UVR  (added  in  Download  Center,  but  the  problem  was  
also
 
fixed
 
by
 
Anjok
 
and
 
added
 
in
 
the
 
OG
 
repo’s
 
yaml)
  -  New  Ensemble  button  added  on  x-minus  for  premium  users  for  the  new  inst  unwa’s  model.  
It
 
corrects
 
the
 
phase
 
and
 
almost
 
removes
 
the
 
noise
 
existing
 
in
 
this
 
model
 
 
“This
 
post-processing
 
uses
 
Kim's
 
model.
 
After
 
post-processing,
 
the
 
vocals
 
will
 
be
 
replaced
 with  those  of  this  model.”  Examples Using  Mel-Roformer  de-noise  might  be  better  alternative:  “removes  more  noise  from  the  song,  keeping  overall  instrument  quality  more  than  the  new  
button”
 
koseidon72.
 
But
 
the
 
more
 
aggressive
 
variant
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
sometimes
 
deletes
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
mix,
 
like
 
snares.
  -  New  Bas  Curtiz  fine-tuned  on  MVSEP  and  unwa’s  inst  Mel-Band  added  on  MVSEP  and  
x-minus.
 
Although
 
there
 
were
 
only
 
5
 
submission
 
sent
 
to
 
ZFTurbo
 
for
 
fine-tuning,
 
and
 
30+
 
is
 
needed,
 
so
 
there
 
is
 
not
 
so
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
difference
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
FT.
 “I  suggest  to  all  of  you,  if  there  is  any  voice  left  [in  inst  v1],  use  the  Mel-Roformer  de-noise  
with
 
minimal
 
aggression.
 
“not
 
only
 
for
 
little
 
voices
 
left,
 
but
 
also
 
for
 
some
 
background
 
noise.
 Unfortunately,  this  new  [unwa’s]  model  doesn't  eliminate  vocoder  voices  well  from  an  
instrumental”
 The  model  is  much  faster  than  beta  4.   -  unwa  released  a  new  Mel-Roformer  model  focused  on  instrumental  stem  this  time  (a.k.a.  
v1):
