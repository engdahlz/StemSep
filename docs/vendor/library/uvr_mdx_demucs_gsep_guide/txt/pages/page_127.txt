    “It  now  performs  better  on  songs  with  2  people  singing  the  lead  No  longer  separates  the  second  lead  along  with  it”   -dca100fb8  found  out  new  settings for  KaraFan which  give  good  results  for  some  difficult  songs  (e.g.  Juice  WRLD)  for  both  instrumental  and  acapella.  It’s  now  added  as  preset  5.   Debug  mode  and  God  mode  can  be  disabled,  as  it's  like  that  by  default.   "It's  like  an  improved  version  of  Max  Spec  ensemble  algorithm  [from  UVR]"   Processing  time  for  6:16  track  on  medium  setting  is  22  minutes.   -  New  MDX23C  model  added  exclusively  on  MVSEP:  vocals  SDR  10.17  ->  10.36  instrum  SDR  16.48  ->  16.66  Also  ensemble  4  got  updated  by  new  model  (10.32>10.44  for  vocals)   -  For  some  people  using  mitmproxy  scripts  for  Capcut  (but  not  everyone),  they  “changed

 “At  60%  it  looks  like  the  progress  isn't  going  up,  but  give  it  idk,  1  min  tops,  and  it  splits  fine.”  -

  -ZFTurbo  published  his  training  code:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training  "It  gives  the  ability  to  train  5  types  of  models:  mdx23c,  htdemucs,  vitlarge23,  bs_roformer  
and
 
mel_band_roformer.
 I  also  put  some  weights  there  to  not  start  training  from  the  beginning."  It  contains  checkpoint  of  e.g.  1648  (1017  for  vocals)  MDX23C  model  to  train  it  further.  Be  aware  that  the  older  bs_roformer  implementation  is  very  slow  to  train  IRC.  Vitlarge23  “is  running  2  times  faster  than  MDX  models,  it's  not  the  best  quality  available,  but  
it's
 
the
 
fastest
 
inference”
 “change  the  batch  size  in  config  tho  I  think  zfturbo  sets  the  default  config  suited  for  a  single  a6000  (48gb)  and  chunksize”   -"A  small  update  to  the  backing  vocals  extractor  [on  X-Minus]   Now  you  can  more  accurately  specify  the  panning  of  the  lead  vocal."  ~Aufr33  Screen
