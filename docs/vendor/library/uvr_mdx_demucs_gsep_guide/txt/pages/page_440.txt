    Speed  and  chunks  affect  quality.  The  slower,  the  muddier,  but  also  slightly  less  vocal  
residues,
 
although
 
they’ll
 
be
 
still
 
there
 
(just
 
slightly
 
quieter).
 
I’d
 
recommend
 
the
 
“fastest”
 
Speed
 
setting
 
and
 
400K
 
chunks
 
for
 
the
 
current
 
P5
 
(tested
 
on
 
4:07
 
song,
 
may
 
not
 
work
 
for
 
longer
 
tracks).
 
  -  If  you  replace  Inst  Voc  HQ1  model  by  HQ2  using  AI  Hub  fork  in  current  P5,  the  instrumental  
will
 
be
 
muddier.
  -  To  preserve  instruments  which  are  counted  as  vocals  by  other  MDXv2  models,  use  these preset’s  5  modified  settings  -  they  have  more  clarity  than  P5  and  preserve  hi-hats  better.  But  
to
 
preserve
 
the
 
same
 
processing
 
time
 
as
 
in
 
P5,
 
but
 
setting
 
“Speed”
 
slider
 
to
 
medium,
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
more
 
constant
 
vocal
 
residues
 
vs
 
P5
 
with
 
the
 
slowest
 
setting
 
(too
 
much
 
at
 
times,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
serve
 
well
 
for
 
specific
 
song
 
fragments).
 
It
 
will
 
take
 
12
 
minutes+
 
for
 
3:24
 
track
 
on
 
medium.
 
Debug
 
and
 
God
 
mode
 
on
 
the
 
screenshot
 
are
 
unrelated
 
and
 
optional.
  -  To  fix  issues  with  saxophone  in  P5  use  these settings.  They  even  have  more  clarity  than  the  one  above,  but  also  more  hearable  vocal  residues.  It  helps  to  preserve  instruments  
better
 
than
 
the
 
setting
 
from
 
the
 
above.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
better
 
than
 
P2
 
-
 
less
 
hearable
 
consistent
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
but
 
in
 
similar
 
amount,
 
while
 
on
 
other
 
artists
 
sax
 
preset
 
even
 
gives
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
P2.
 
Sax
 
setting
 
is
 
worse
 
in
 
preserving
 
piano
 
than
 
the
 
setting
 
above.
 -  Using  the  slowest  setting  here  in  sax  fix  preset  will  result  in  disconnection  of  runtime  with  
free
 
T4
 
after
 
28
 
minutes
 
of
 
processing,
 
but
 
it
 
should
 
succeed
 
anyway
 
(result
 
files
 
might
 
be
 
uploaded
 
on
 
GDrive
 
after
 
some
 
time
 
anyway).
 
 Vs  medium,  the  slowest  setting  gives  more  muffled  sound,  but  not  always  less  vocal  
residues.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
heard
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
short
 
parts
 
with
 
only
 
vocals.
 
18
 
minutes
 
for
 
4:07
 
track
 
on
 
Fast
 
setting
 
(God
 
Mode
 
and
 
Debug
 
Mode
 
are
 
disabled
 
in
 
KaraFan
 
by
 
default).
 
  After  3-4  ~18  minutes  separations  (in  this  case  not  made  in  batch,  but  with  manually  
changed
 
parameters
 
in
 
the
 
middle),
 
when
 
you
 
terminate
 
and
 
delete
 
environment,
 
you
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
GPUs
 
again
 
as
 
the
 
limit
 
will
 
be
 
reached
 
unless
 
you
 
switch
 
Colab
 
account
 
(mount
 
the
 
same
 
GDrive
 
account
 
as
 
Colab
 
to
 
avoid
 
errors)
  -  Preset  5  provides  more  muffled  results  than  the  two  settings  above,  but  with  good  balance  
of
 
clarity
 
and
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
Sometimes
 
this
 
one
 
has
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
sometimes
 
16.66
 
MDX23C
 
model
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
(or
 
possibly
 
a
 
bit
 
older
 
HQ_1
 
model
 
in
 
UVR),
 
it
 
can
 
even
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
fragment.
  
Using
 
newer
 
MDX23C
 
HQ
 
2
 
in
 
P5
 
instead
 
of
 
MDX23C
 
HQ
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
produce
 
better
 
results
  After  5th  separation  (not  in  batch)  you  must  start  your  next  separation  very  fast  because  or  
you’ll
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
Colab
 
free
 
limit
 
when
 
GUI
 
is
 
in
 
idle
 
state.
 
In
 
such
 
case,
 
switch
 
Colab
 
account,
 
and
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
account
 
to
 
mount
 
GDrive
 
(or
 
you
 
might
 
encounter
 
error).
