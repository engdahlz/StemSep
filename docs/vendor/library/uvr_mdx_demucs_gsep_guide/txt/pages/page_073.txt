  -  ZFTurbo,  the  owner  of  MVSEP,  seeks  help  on  improving  Bas  Curtiz’  ft  Mel-Roformer  model  
on
 
MVSEP.
 
How
 
can
 
you
 
help?
 
1)
 
Find
 
a
 
badly
 
separated
 
song
 
with
 
this
 
model
 
(e.g.
 
bleeding)
 
2)
 
Find
 
other
 
model
 
which
 
separates
 
your
 
song
 
correctly
 
3)
 
Send
 
the
 
good
 
results
 
(instrumental
 
stem
 
+
 
vocal
 
stem
 
in
 
stereo/44kHz
 
with
 
the
 
same
 length)  to  ZFTurbo  on  Discord  (or  email)  The  result  will  be  used  as  input  for  training  a  new,  fine-tuned  model.   -  “1)  All  [MVSEP]  ensembles  now  use  Bas  Curtiz  MelRoformer  model.  SDR  for  Multi  dataset  
stayed
 
almost
 
the
 
same,
 
but
 
greatly
 
increased

Sometimes  FLAC  option  might  not  work,  then  download  mp3  first,  and  then  FLAC  will  work  (the  files  have  full  22kHz  spectrum).  Although,  sometimes  it  may  
fail
 
anyway
