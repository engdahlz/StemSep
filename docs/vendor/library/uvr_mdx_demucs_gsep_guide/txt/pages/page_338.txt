    it  seems  to  benefit  from  running  the  centre  channel  results  back  through  the  model  for  more

results

more
 
complete
 
results
 
although
 
with
 
the
 
trade-off
 
of
 
more
 
bleed
 you  end  up  with  overall  more  bleed  than  the  other  model  but  with  even  more  complete  
results”

 The  command  for  Nvidia  GPU,  but  CPU  inferencing  should  be  possible  too.  
 -  2048  MDX23C  model by  wesleyr36/drypaintdealerundr   Can  be  used  on  MVSEP  (in  Experimental  section)  and  x-minus.pro  (option  Extract  backing  vocals)  or  using  ZFTurbo  inference  CML  code (it  doesn’t  work  in  the  OG  MDX23C  inference  code  and  in  UVR).   “This  model  is  similar  to  the  Center  Channel  Extractor  effect  in  Adobe  Audition  or  Center  
Extract
 
in
 
iZotope
 
RX
 
[and
 
Audacity/Bertom],
 
but
 
works
 
better.
 
 Although  it  does  not  isolate  vocals,  it  can  be  useful.”  Aufr33   “The  main  thing  I  trained  it  for  was  to  be  used  in  a  similarity  extractor,  since  the  original  also  
used
 
an
 
AI
 
model
 The  steps  for  that  being:  1.  Take  the  L  channel  from  Audio_1  and  the  L  channel  from  Audio_2  and  merge  them  into  a  
stereo
 
file.
 2.  Run  that  through  the  model  3.  Repeat  for  R  channels  4.  Merge  the  L  and  R  channels  back  together,  and  you  have  the  similarity,  assuming  the  
audio
 
files
 
were
 
perfectly
 
aligned.”
