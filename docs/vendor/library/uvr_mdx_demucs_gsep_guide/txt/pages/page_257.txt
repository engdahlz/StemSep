    (by  Aufr33  &  jarredou)  Seems  to  pick  up  room  reverb.  Previous  Foxy’s  model  sometimes  cut  “way  too  much”  than  
this
 
model.
 Copy  model  file  to  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\MDX_Net_Models  and  yaml  config  to  
\model_data\mdx_c_configs
 
subfolder.
  Bas  Curtiz’  conclusion  on  both:  -  MDX23C  “seems  to  be  cleaner,  takes  the  reverb  away,  also  between  the  words,  whereas  (U)VR  leaves  a  little  reverb  -  VR  “seems  to  sound  more  natural,  maybe  therefore  actually.  -  MDX23C  tends  to  'pinch'  some  stuff  away  to  the  background,  which  sounds  unnatural.   “This  is  just  based  on  my  experience  with  3  songs/comparisons,  but  both  points  are  a  
pattern.
 Overall,  they're  both  great  when  u  compare  them  against  the  original  reverbed/untouched  vocals.”  showcase  video.   -  You  can  find  older  avuew  Mel  versions  here  -  BS-Roformer  anvuew  variant  (a.k.a.  8/256/8)  |  DL -  a  bit  higher  SDR  than  Mel  v1  (8/26/6)  posted  firstly  in  ZFTurbo  repo.  
“not
 
good
 
is
 
all
 
people
 
say”
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
use
 
case
 
or
 
a
 
song.
 Mel-Roformer  might  turn  out  to  be  better  more  often  “works  weirdly  and  leaves  some  echo  
for
 
some
 
reason”
 
“very
 
usable
 
for
 
single
 
singing
 
voices
 
and
 
speech,
 
cus
 
it's
 
very
 
precise
 
in
 
eliminating
 
echo
 
and
 
reverb,
 but  if  you  have  a  choir  singing  or  vocals  with  backing  vocals  in  it,  then  it'll  probably  ruin  it  a  
bit.
 
For
 
such
 
vocals
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
use
 
aufr33/jarredou
 
model
 
or
 
dereverb
 
deecho”

  To  fix  issues  with  BS  variant  of  the  model  in  UVR  “change  stft_hop_length:  512  to  
stft_hop_length:
 
441
 
so
 
it
 
matches
 
the
 
hop_length
 
above”
 
in
 
the
 
yaml
 
file
 
(thx
 
lew),
 
plus
 
delete
 
linear_transformer
 
line
 
in
 
the
 
config
 
like
 
above
 
too.
  -  8  384  dim  10  depth  BS  variant  |  dl |  config  -  #2  Sucial  Mel-Roformer  dereverb/echo  model  (model |  MVSEP).  Fine-tune  with  more  training  data.  
 -  #1  Sucial  Mel-Roformer  dereverb/echo  model  (model |  MVSEP).  It’s  good  but  doesn’t  seem  to  be  better  than  the  anvuew's  Mel  v2  model  above  (models  list).  Still,  might  depend  on  a  use  case.  
 -  older  V1  de-reverb  HQ  MDX  model  by  FoxyJoy  (dl)  (source)  (also  decent  results,  but  most  likely  worse).  (“It  uses  the  default  older  architecture  with  the  fft  size  of  6144”
