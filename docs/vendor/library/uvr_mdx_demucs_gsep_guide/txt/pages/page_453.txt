    models  like  private  one  by  ZFTurbo,  and  fine-tunes  by  various  users  (Kim,  Unwa,  Bas,  
ZFTurbo)
  Bas  tried  to  train  a  model  purely  on  multisong  dataset  only,  but  failed  to  surpass  the  SDR  
score
 
of
 
a
 
1.1
 
Bytedance’s
 
model
 
anyway.
 
v1.1
 
has
 
new
 
arch
 
enhancements
 
to
 
the
 
arch,
 and  will  be  presented  on  ISMIR2024  (white  paper  is  already  out;  link  in  the  Training  section).   
Drumsep  -  single  percussion  instruments  separation   If  you  want  to  further  separate  single  instruments  from  drums  stem  separated  with  e.g.  
MDX23
 
Colab,
 
Mel-Roformer
 
drums
 
on
 
x-minus.pro
 
premium,
 
MVSEP,
 
or
 
Demucs_ft
 
(not
 
necessarily
 
BS-Roformer
 
SW)
 
into:
 
hihat,
 
cymbals,
 
kick,
 
snare
 
and
 
more,
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
check
 
below
 
solutions.
 
Sampling
 
from
 
such
 
separated
 
stems
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
the
 
best
 
idea
 
due
 to  the  quality  (see  here for  free  Drumclone  plugin  allowing  even  different  types  of  synthesised  kicks  from  mixture;  video).  But  e.g.  it  serves  well  for  purposes  of  conducting  new  mixes/remasters  of  the  same  songs  or  separated  instrumentals,  e.g.  when  it's  
overlapped
 
with
 
better
 
quality,
 
previously
 
separated
 
drums
 
stem.
 
It
 
might
 
give
 
interesting
 
results
 
when
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
original
 
drums,
 
and
 
rebalanced
 
with
 
effects
 
(drums
 
stem
 
might
 
end
 
up
 
louder
 
in
 
the
 
mix
 
than
 
separated
 
percussion,
 
as
 
most
 
likely
 
it
 
will
 
still
 
have
 
better
 
quality).
 
Check
 
out
 
these
 
drum
 
replacers.
  To  potentially  increase  drumsep  models  separation  quality,  “try  using  a  small  pitch  shift  up  or  
down,
 
like
 
+/-
 
1
 
or
 
2
 
semitones
 
(...)
 
can
 
sometimes
 
help
 
bring
 
out
 
the
 
lows
 
or
 
highs
 
if
 
they
 
seem
 
weak.”

 Also,  consider  using  good  instrumental  model  before  using  4  stem  model  for  drums  (if  it's  not  
instrumental
 
already),
 
to
 
enhance
 
drums
 
stem,
 
and
 
then
 
to
 
enhance
 
drumsep
 
result.
  Some  drumsep  models  might  have  a  bug  where  “a  small,  but  relevant  portion  of  audio  is  
being
 
lost
 
when
 
the
 
[drumsep]
 
model
 
is
 
being
 
used”
 
 “The  solution  is  to  invert  the  phase  on  all  the  drum  stems  into  the  original  file  and  save  that  
as
 
its
 
own
 
file,
 
making
 
your
 
own
 
"other"
 
file”.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
fixed
 
on
 
MVSEP.
 
Mel-Roformer  MVSEP  drumsep  models   1)  4  stems  v2  (kick,  snare,  toms,  cymbals)  -  “It  gives  the  best  metrics  with  a  big  gap  for  kick,  
snare
 
and
 
cymbals.”
 
-
 
ZFTurbo.
 
The
 
old
 
v1
 
below
 
was
 
removed.
 (metrics;  only  toms  are  worse  SDR-wise  vs  previous  SCNet  Drumsep  models  below)  1)  4  stems  v1  removed  (kick,  snare,  toms,  cymbals)  -  average  SDR  of  hihat  ride,  crash  is  
11,52
 
(but
 
in
 
one
 
stem)
 
and
 
so
 
far
 
it’s
 
the
 
best
 
SDR
 
out
 
of
 
all
 
models
 
(even
 
vs
 
the
 
previous
 
ensemble
 
consisting
 
of
 
three
 
MDX23C
 
and
 
SCNet
 
models).
 
 2)  6  stems  (kick,  snare,  toms,  hihat,  ride,  crash)  -  average  SDR  of  hihat  ride,  crash  is  8.18  
(but
 
from
 
separated
 
stems),
