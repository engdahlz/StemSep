 -  Logic  Pro  (paid; May  2025  update,  SDR  7.79) /  BS-Roformer  6  stems  /  MVSEP  Piano  SW  (“1000  times  more  efficient  than  the  Lalal.ai  piano  model”)   -  Lalal.ai  (paid;  no  other  stem  with  piano  stem  attached)  -  Demix  Pro  (paid;  “I  often  combine  the  two”  -  Mixman,  but  it  was  before  the  6  stems  above)   -  MVSep  Piano  Ensemble  (Mel-Roformer   +  SCNet  Large  piano  models;  SDR  6.21)  
(Mel
 
is
 
viperx'
 
iirc;
 
“a
 
[tiny]
 
bit
 
more
 
bleed
 
during
 
the
 
choruses
 
and
 
whatnot”
 
vs
 
x-minus,
 
“works
 
well
 
maybe
 
7
 
times
 
out
 
of
 
10”;
 
SCNet,
 
“has
 
a
 
less
 
watery
 
sound,
 
but
 
more
 
bleed”
 
vs
 
Mel)
 -  x-minus.pro  (for  paid  users;  cheap  subscription;  “more  consistent  than  MVSep  piano  and  
demucs_6s”
 
it
 
knows
 
well
 
what
 
piano
 
is,
 
but
 
it
 
sounds
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
other
 
stem
 
of
 
piano
 
separation,
 
but
 
e.g.
 
on
 
Carpenters

“while
 
not
 
terrible,
 
the
 
dropouts,
 
underwater
 
'gurgles',
 
and
 
general
 
lack

punch/presence
 
remains
 
noticeable”

Chris_tang1,
 
while
 
MVSEP
 
Piano
 
Ensemble:
 
SCNet
 
+
 
Mel,
 
SDR:
 
6.21,
 
was
 
much
 
better
 
in
 
that
 
case
 
-
 
might
 
vary
 
on
 
a
 
song)
  -  Music.ai  (paid)  -  Dango.ai  (paid)  -  GSEP  (formerly  best,  paid)  -  Moises  (separate  models  for  piano  and  keys)  -  MVSep  Piano  MDX23C  2024  &  2023  -  htdemucs_6s  (not  too  good)   -  MVSEP  Digital  Piano  (much  better  for  epiano,  and  sometimes  also  for  real  or  synthesiser  
when
 
it's
 
picked
 
vs
 
the
 
SW
 
model)
  -  MVSep  Keys   -  MVSep  Harpsichord   -  MVSep  Celesta   Synths  -  MVSep  Synth  (it  can  also  pick  some  bass  which  some  bass  models  failed  to  pick  up)  -  MVSep  Organ  -  Piano  or  guitar  models  might  work  (if  the  song  doesn't  have  piano  or  guitar  already)  
depends
 
on
 
a
 
song
 -  Zero  Shot -  lalal.ai  (hit  or  miss,  sometimes  might  not  work)
