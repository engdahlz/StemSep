[page 445/642]
    At  least  the  unlocked  version  on  apklite.me  have  a  link  to  the  regular  version,  so  it  doesn't  
seem
 
to
 
be
 
Pro
 
app
 
behind
 
any
 
regional
 
block.
 
But
 
-
 "Indian  users  -  Use  VPN  for  Pro"  as  they  say,  so  similar  situation  like  we  had  on  PC  Capcut  
before.
 
Can't
 
guarantee
 
that
 
unlocked
 
version
 
on
 
apklite.me
 
is
 
clean.
 
I've
 
never
 
downloaded
 
anything
 
from
 
there.
  Bleeding   Bas  Curtiz  found  out  that  decreasing  volume  of  mixtures  for  Ripple  by  -3dB  (sometimes  -4dB)  eliminates  problems  with  vocal  residues  in  instrumentals  in  Ripple.  Video  This  is  the  most  balanced  value,  which  still  doesn't  take  too  many  details  out  of  the  song  due  
to
 
volume
 
attenuation.
 Other  good  values  purely  SDR-wise  are  -20dB>-8dB>-30dB>-6dB>-4dB>  /wo  vol.  decr.    The  method  might  be  potentially  beneficial  for  other  models,  and  probably  work  best  for  the  
loudest
 
tracks
 
with
 
brickwalled
 
waveforms.
  The  other  stem  is  gathered  from  inversion  to  speed  up  the  separation  process.  The  
consequence
 
is
 
bleeding
 
in
 
instrumentals.
 -  If  you  suffer  from  bleeding  in  other  stem  of  4  stems  Ripple,  beside  decreasing  volume  by  
e.g.
 
3/4dB
 
also
 
“when
 
u
 
throw
 
the
 
'other
 
stem'
 
back
 
into
 
ripple
 
4
 
track
 
split
 
a
 
second
 
time,
 
it
 
works
 
pretty
 
well
 
[to
 
cancel
 
the
 
bleeding]”
  The  forte  of  the  Ripple  is  currently  vocals  -  the  algo  is  very  good  at  differentiating  what  is  
vocals
 
and
 
what
 
is
 
not,
 
although
 
they
 
can
 
sound
 
“filtered”
 
at
 
times.
  Currently,  the  best  SDR  for  public  model/AI,  but  it  gives  the  best  results  for  vocals  in  general.  
For
 
instrumentals,
 
it
 
rather
 
doesn’t
 
beat
 
paid
 
Dango.ai
 
(and
 
rather
 
not
 
KaraFan
 
and
 
HQ_3
 
or
 
1648/MDX23C
 
fullband
 
too).
  It's  good  for  vocals,  also  for  cleaning  vocal  inverts,  and  surprisingly  good  for  e.g.  Christmas  
songs,
 
(it
 
handled
 
hip-hop,
 
e.g.
 
Drake
 
pretty
 
well).
 
It's
 
better
 
for
 
vocals
 
than
 
instrumentals
 
due
 
to
 
residues
 
in
 
other
 
stem
 
-
 
bass
 
is
 
very
 
good,
 
drums
 
also
 
decent,
 
kicks
 
even
 
one
 
if
 
not
 
the
 
best
 
out
 
of
 
all
 
models,
 
as
 
they
 
said
 
some
 
fine-tuning
 
was
 
applied
 
to
 
drums
 
stem.
 
Vocals
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
inversion
 
to
 
get
 
instrumentals,
 
and
 
it
 
may
 
sound
 
clean,
 
but
 
rather
 
not
 
as
 
good
 
as
 
what
 
2
 
stem
 
option
 
or
 
3
 
stem
 
mixdown
 
gives
 
as
 
output
 
is
 
lossy.
  Capcut  (2  stems  only)  https://www.capcut.cn/ It  is  a  new  Windows  and  Android  app  which  contains  the  same  arch  as  Ripple  inst/vocal,  but  
lower
 
quality
 
model,
 
and
 
without
 
an
 
option
 
of
 
exporting
 
4
 
stems.
