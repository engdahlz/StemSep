    That  feature  made  UVR  and  VR  arch  much  better.   Later  they  introduced  -   Ensembling  So  a  way  to  use  multiple  models  to  potentially  get  better  results.  The  three  ways  of  ensembling:  avg  -  gets  the  average  of  vocals/instrumentals  max  -  is  maximum  result  of  each  stem,  e.g.  in  a  vocal  you'll  get  the  heaviest  weighted  vocal  
from
 
each
 
model,
 
and
 
the
 
same
 
goes
 
for
 
instrumental,
 
giving
 
a
 
bit
 
cleaner
 
results,
 
but
 
more
 
artefacts
 min   MDX-Net   Uses  full  spectrogram  with  phase  and  magnitude  Tradeoff  is  muddier  results,  but  natural,  cleaner  sound.   Training   Anjok  separated  on  nearly  every  genre  you  can  think  of,  and  stated  that  the  hardest  genre  
for
 
separation
 
is
 
metal
 
and
 
vocal-centered
 
mixes.
 
Also,
 
if
 
the
 
instrumental
 
has
 
lot
 
of
 
noise,
 
e.g.
 
distorted
 
guitars,
 
the
 
instrumental
 
will
 
come
 
out
 
muddier.
 MDX-Net  was  the  arch,  addressing  lots  of  VR  issues  in  its  core.  Tracks  from  70-80s  can  separate  well.  50-60s  will  be  harder,  e.g.  recorded  in  mono.  Early  
stereo
 
era
 
gets
 
a
 
little
 
better.
  A  good  model  needs  to  be  as  good  as  the  dataset  for  a  model.  There  was  lots  of  work  scrapping  it  from  the  internet.  Aufr33  was  the  mastermind  behind  Karaoke  model  and  its  dataset.  Demucs  model  wasn't  as  successful,  as  probably  was  more  meant  for  more  stems,  and  
MDX-Net
 
gave
 
better
 
results
 
for
 
2
 
stems.
  Training  details  covered  in  this  interview  can  be  found  at  the  top  of  Traning  models  guide  section  of  the  doc   The  biggest  issue  in  terms  of  archs  and  the  source  of  muddiness,  is  phase.  Currently,  in  
audio
 
separation
 
there's
 
not
 
a
 
great
 
way
 
to
 
calculate
 
phase
 
in
 
a
 
model
 
like
 
the
 
phase
 
spectrogram
 
as
 
it's
 
not
 
as
 
obvious
 
as
 
the
 
magnitude
 
spectrogram.
  You  take  the  vocal  out  of  a  heavy  rock  track,  but  the  process  is  not  perfect,  so  it  will  take  
some
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
instrumental
 
with
 
it.
 
Even
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
hear
 
instrumental
 
in
 
vocals,
 
there's
 
still
 
instrumental
 
data
 
in
 
there
 
in
 
the
 
phase
 
of
 
that
 
vocal
 
track.
