Probably,
 
5700
 
XT
 
with
 
some
 
older
 
ROCm
 
versions
 
(e.g.
 
older
 
than
 
6.33)
 
might
 
work
 
too
  (e.g.  HIP  5.7  and  ROCm  around  5.2.*  -  src,  although  you  can  try  out  6.21  or  6.2.x  to  ensure,  as  it  could  happen  that  some  earlier  6.x  wasn’t  supporting  RX  5700  XT  correctly,  while  e.g.  
for
 
RX
 
6000
 
ROCm
 
6.24
 
worked
 
in
 
some
 
apps
 
at
 
some
 
point,
 
but
 
more
 
up-to-date
 
information
 
might
 
be
 
found
 
in
 
some
 
ZLUDA
 
guides,
 
as
 
it
 
needs
 
ROCm
 
too
 
-
 
some
 suggestions  here).  -  The  most  performance  gains  on  ROCm  7  might  be  potentially  observed  on  officially  
supported
 
GPUs
 
like
 
Instinct
 
MI350
 
CDNA
 
4,
 
providing
 
even
 
3-7x
 
performance
 
gains
 
over
 6.0  in  some  applications  (more).   -  Official  support  for  RX  400/500  (a.k.a.  Polaris/GCN  4/GFX803)  GPUs  support  was  dropped,  but  you  can  follow  this repo  for  unofficial  ROCm  6  support.  Or  for  ROCm  5,  this Ubuntu  guide  (it  might  even  potentially  work  from  Windows  using  WSL  [if  using  at  least  Ubuntu  22.04  LTS]  with  almost  no  GPU  performance  overhead).  There  
seemed
 
to
 
be
 
some
 
issues
 
building
 
Torch
 
(UtilsAVX512.cc/tensorpipe)
 
on
 
Python
 
3.13,
 
fixed
 
on
 
Python
 
3.10,
 
and
 
maybe
 
3.11.9.
 Also,  there  seems  to  be  some  Arch  Linux  community  package  to  install  Pytorch  still  compatible  for  these  GPUs  (click).  Or  also  might  be  potentially  supported  with  some  other  specific  versions  of  ROC,  e.g.  5.7.2  
and
 
also
 
described
 
above:
 export  ROC_ENABLE_PRE_VEGA=1  (deprecated  in  ROCm  6;  might  help  for  lacking  
dependencies
 
or
 
wheel
 
building
 
issues).
 
Or
 
check
 
out
 
also
 
this:
 https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/10435#issuecomment-1555399844,  or  alternatively  follow  below  instructions:  https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and  then  execute:  pip3  install  torch  torchvision  torchaudio  --index-url  https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2 -  Since  then  also  ROCm  6.4.4  allowing  using  PyTorch  natively  on  Linux  and  Windows  on  RX  7000  and  9000  was  released  (more),  but  it  wasn’t  tested  yet  (DL).  You  might  get  the  error using  at  least  WebUI.  -  Also,  you  might  want  to  experiment  with  using  ZLUDA  in  UVR  (CUDA>ROCm  translation  layer  -  some  suggestions  here).    >fr4z49  ROCm  report:  -  “I  managed  to  make MSST-WebUI work  [on  Linux]  with:   Torch  2.10.0.dev20251110+rocm7.0   on  RX  7600  (...)  it  seems  like  ROCm  7.0  is  about  a  second  faster  [than  6.x]”   
(probably
 
by
 
adding
 
just
 
pip
 
install
 
before
 
it)
  Turns  out  that  if  you  do:  export  TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1  it  uses  waay  less  VRAM  and  processes  even  faster.
