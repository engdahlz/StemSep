     It  can  be  beneficial  also  in  case  of  more  vocal  residues  of  MDX23  or  Demucs  ft  model  
compared
 
to
 
current
 
MDX
 
models
 
or
 
their
 
ensembles.
  22.  If  you  still  have  instrumental  bleeding  in  vocals  using  voc_ft,  process  the  result  further  
with
 
Kim
 
vocal

  23.  Rearrange  cleaner  parts   When  a  verse  starts,  and  you  start  having  muddy  drums  and  their  pattern  is  consistent  (e.g.  
some
 
hip-hop),
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
cleaner
 
drums
 
from
 
fragments
 
before
 
the
 
verse
 
starts,
 
you
 
can
 
rearrange
 
drums
 
manually,
 
using
 
4
 
stems
 
model
 
and
 
paste
 
that
 
cleaner
 
fragments
 
throughout
 
the
 
track.
 
Sometimes
 
fade
 
outs
 
or
 
intros
 
can
 
have
 
clean
 
loops
 
without
 
vocals,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
rearranged
 
without
 
even
 
the
 
need
 
of
 
separation.
 
Listen
 
carefully
 
to
 
the
 
track.
 
Such
 
moments
 
can
 
be
 
even
 
briefly
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
of
 
the
 
song.
 
24.  arigato78  method  for  lead  vocal  acapella   1)  Try  to  make  the  best  acapella  (using  mvsep.com  site  or  using  UVR  GUI).  I  recommend  
the
 
MDXB
 
Voc
 
FT
 
model
 
for
 
this
 
with
 
an
 
overlap
 
setting
 
set
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
0.80
 
(I
 
used
 
0.95
 
for
 
this
 
example).
 
The
 
overlap
 
for
 
this
 
model
 
at
 
mvsep.com
 
is
 
set
 
to
 
0.80.
 
Speaking
 
of
 
the
 
"segment
 
size"
 
parameter
 
in
 
UVR
 
GUI
 
-
 
changing
 
it
 
from
 
320
 
to
 
1024
 
doesn't
 
make
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
difference.
 
It
 
acts
 
randomly,
 
but
 
we're
 
working
 
on
 
a
 
beta
 
version
 
of
 
UVR
 
GUI
 
-
 
remember
 
that.
 
(...)
 I  noticed  all  the  "vocal-alike"  instruments  still  remaining  on  the  acapella  track,  but  wait...  2)  The  second  part  is  to  process  the  acapella  thru  the  mdx  karaoke  model  (I  did  it  using  
mvsep.com).
 
I
 
prefer
 
the
 
file
 
with
 
"vocalsaggr"
 
in
 
the
 
name.
 
It
 
has
 
more
 
details
 
than
 
the
 
file
 
with
 
"vocals"
 
in
 
it.
 
The
 
same
 
goes
 
to
 
the
 
background
 
vocals
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
-
 
I
 
prefer
 
the
 
"instrumentalaggr"
 
one.
 One  important  thing  -  all  (maybe  almost)  of  the  residue  instrumental  sounds  were  taken  by  
mdx
 
karaoke
 
model
 
to
 
the
 
backing
 
vocals
 
stem,
 
leaving
 
the
 
lead
 
vocal
 
almost
 
studio
 
quality
 
("studio").
 
But
 
-
 
it
 
may
 
be
 
helpful
 
for
 
all
 
you
 
guys
 
trying
 
to
 
make
 
good
 
acapellas.
 
I
 
was
 
just
 
playing
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
models
 
and
 
parameters
 
and
 
I
 
accidentally
 
came
 
across
 
this.
 
Please,
 
let
 
me
 
know
 
what
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
it.
 
I'm
 
gonna
 
try
 
this
 
on
 
some
 
tracks
 
with
 
flutes,
 
etc.
 
And
 
I
 
realize
 
that
 
this
 
method
 
is
 
not
 
perfect
 
-
 
we
 
get
 
nice
 
lead
 
vocals,
 
but
 
the
 
backing
 
vocals
 
are
 
left
 
with
 
all
 
that
 
sh*tty
 
residues.
 So  the  track  is  called  "Reward"  by  Polish  singer  Basia  Trzetrzelewska  from  her  1989  album  
"London,
 
Warsaw,
 
New
 
York".
 __   25.  Uneven  quality  of  separated  vocals   You  can  downmix  your  separated  vocal  result  to  mono  and  repeat  the  separation  (works  for  
e.g.
 
BVE
 
model
 
on
 
x-minus).
