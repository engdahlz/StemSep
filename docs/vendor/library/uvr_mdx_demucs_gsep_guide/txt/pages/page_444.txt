 Min.  iOS  version:  14.1  Ripple  is  only  for  US  region  (which  you  can  change,  more  below)  Ripple  no  longer  separates  stems  (there's  an  error  "couldn't  complete  processing  please  
try
 
again")
 Ripple  for  iOS:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ripple-music-creation-tool/id6447522624 Capcut  for  Android:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas (separation  only  for  Pro,  Indian  users  sometimes  via  VPN)  Capcut  a.k.a.  Jianying  (2  stems)  works  also  on  Windows  (only  in  Jianying  Pro,  separation  
option
 
is
 
available)
 Can  be  used  instead  of  Ripple  if  you're  on  unsupported  iOS  below  14.1  or  don’t  have  iOS.  To  
get
 
Ripple
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
a
 
virtual
 
machine
 
remotely
 
instead
 
(instructions
 
below).
 
Ripple
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
run
 
on
 
your
 
M1
 
Mac
 
using
 
app
 
sideloading
 
(instructions
 
below).
 
  Ripple  =  better  quality  than  CapCut  as  of  now  (and  fullband)  with  fixed  the  click/artifacts  using  cross-fade  technique  between  the  chunks.   Capcut  =  “the  results  are  really  low  quality  but  if  you  export  the  instrumental  and  invert  it  with  
the
 
lossless
 
track,
 
you
 
will
 
get
 
the
 
vocals
 
with
 
the
 
noise
 
which
 
is
 
easy
 
to
 
remove
 
with
 
mdx
 
voc
 
ft
 
for
 
example,
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
invert
 
the
 
lossless
 
processed
 
vocals
 
with
 
the
 
original
 
and
 
have
 
it
 
in
 
better
 
quality.
 
 The  vocals  are  very  clean  from  cap  cut,  almost  no  drum  bleed”   Ripple  and  Capcut  uses  SAMI-Bytadance  arch  (later  known  as  BS-Roformer),  but  it’s  a  
different
 
model
 
with
 
worse
 
SDR
 
than
 
on
 
the
 
leaderboard.
 
It
 
was
 
developed
 
by
 
Bytedance
 
(owner
 
of
 
TikTok)
 
for
 
MDX23
 
competition,
 
and
 
holds
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
our
 
MVSEP
 
leaderboard.
 
It
 
was
 
published
 
on
 
iOS
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
US
 
region
 
as
 
“Ripple
 
-
 
Music
 
Creation
 
Tool”
 
app.
 
Furthermore,
 
it's
 
a
 
multifunctional
 
app
 
for
 
audio
 
editing,
 
which
 
also
 
contains
 
a
 
4
 
stem
 
separation
 
model.
 
Similar
 
situation
 
with
 
Capcut
 
(which
 
is
 
2
 
stems
 
only
 
IRC).
 
The
 
model
 
itself
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
for
 
MDX23
 
competition
 
(SAMI
 
ByteDance
 
v1.0),
 
as
 
they
 
said,
 
models
 
for
 
apps
 
were
 
trained
 
on
 
128kbps
 
mp3
 
files
 
to
 
avoid
 
copyright
 
issues,
 
but
 
it’s
 
the
 
same
 
arch,
 
just
 
scores
 
a
 
bit
 
lower
 
(even
 
when
 
exported
 
losslessly
 
for
 
evaluation).
 
SDR
 
for
 
Ripple
 
is
 
naturally
 
better
 
than
 
for
 
Capcut.
  Seems  like  there  is  no  other  Pro  variant  for  Capcut  Android  app,  so  you  need  to  unlock  
regular
 
version
 
to
 
Pro.
