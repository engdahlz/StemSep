[page 118/642]
    -  Using  older  Roformer  beta  patches  for  Mac  M1  doesn’t  allow  you  to  choose  the  Roformer  
parameter
 
to
 
check
 
for
 
custom
 
Roformer
 
models
 
and
 
only
 
config
 
name
 
can
 
be
 
chosen,
 
but
 
no
 
confirm
 
button
 
is
 
available.
 
So
 
the
 
error
 
“File
 
"libv5/tfctdfv3.py",
 
line
 
152,
 
in
 
__init”
 
appears.
 >  Place  the  corresponding  json  file  with  your  model  from  this repo  into:  models\MDX_Net_Models\model_data  beforehand,  to  fix  the  issue.   In  some  cases,  you  may  still  get  the  same  error  anyway  and  to  get  rid  of  it,  you  need  to  edit  
manually
 
model_data.json
 
adding
 
desired
 
model
 
line
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
like
 
your
 
custom
 
model
 
was
 
downloaded
 
from
 
download
 
center.
 
On
 
example
 
of
 
unwa’s
 
beta
 
3:
 },  "d43f93520976f1dab1e7e20f3c540825":{      "config_yaml":  "config_melbandroformer_big.yaml",      "is_roformer":  true      }  Additionally,  you  need  the  model  at  the  end  of  model_data_mapper.json:  
    
"model
 
melband_roformer_big_beta3.ckpt":
 
"config_melbandroformer_big"
 }  Now  copy  the  hash-named  json  file  (d43f93520976f1dab1e7e20f3c540825.json  for  beta  3)  
to
 
model_data
 
folder.
 
  All  the  three  modified  files  for  beta  3  and  other  models  here.   If  you  have  problems  generating  hash  on  first  launch  of  the  model  and  your  model  is  not  
uploaded
 
in
 
the
 
repo
 
above
 
or
 
json
 
is
 
not
 
generated
 
then
 
use
 
Windows
 
installation
 
in
 
VM,
 
or
 ask  some  PC  user  for  the  config.  Potentially  reading  Hash  decoding can  be  helpful.  But  maybe  your  hashed  config  name  will  be  generated  correctly  already  after  you  imported  
the
 
model
 
into
 
UVR
 
(although
 
no
 
confirmation
 
button
 
might
 
prevent
 
it),
 
and
 
now
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
enough
 
to
 
just
 
place
 
the
 
following
 
line
 
like
 
in
 
the
 
jsons
 
presented
 
above:
 
"is_roformer":
 
true”
 
(so
 
after
 
“,”
 
in
 
the
 
yaml
 
line
 
above).
