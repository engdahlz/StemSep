     -  UVR  De-noise  model  by  FoxJoy  added  on  x-minus.  It’s  helpful  for  light  noise,  e.g.  vinyl.  
(de-reverb
 
and
 
de-echo
 
are
 
up
 
already)
 New  MDX  de-noise  model  is  in  the  works  and  beta  model  was  also  added!  “the  instruments  in  the  background  are  preserved  much  better  than  the  FoxJoy  model”  It  works  for  hiss,  interference,  crackle,  rustles  and  soft  footsteps,  technical  noise.    -  New  hifi-gan-bwe  Colab  fork  made  by  jarredou:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/jarredou/hifi-gan-bwe/blob/main/HIFIGAN_BWE.ipynb  -  New  AI  speech  enhancer  -  https://www.resemble.ai/introducing-resemble-enhance  -  Reason  12.5  (a  DAW)  was  released  with  VST3  plugin  support   -  jazzpear94  “I  made  a  new  model with  a  modified  version  of  my  SFX  and  Music  dataset  with  the  addition  of  other/ambiant  sound  and  speech.  It's  a  multistem  model  and  should  even  
work
 
in
 
UVR
 
GUI
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
MDX23C.
 Note:  You  may  want  to  rename  the  config  to  .yaml  as  UVR  doesn't  read  .yml  and  I  didn't  
notice
 
till
 
after
 
sending.
 
Renaming
 
it
 
fixes
 
that,
 
however”
 
 “You  put  config  in  models\mdx_net_models\model_data\mdx_c_configs.  Then  when  you  use  
it
 
in
 
UVR
 
it'll
 
ask
 
you
 
for
 
parameters,
 
so
 
you
 
locate
 
the
 
newly
 
placed
 
config
 
file.”
 “Keep  in  mind  that  the  cinematic  model  focus  is  mainly  on  sfx  vs  instruments  voice  stems  are  supplemental.  Usually  I  remove  voices  first”   -  https://github.com/karnwatcharasupat/bandit Better  SDR  for  Cinematic  Audio  Source  Separation  (dialogue,  effect,  music)  than  Demucs  4

  -  "Demucs+CC_Stereo_to_5.1"  -  it's  a  script  where  you  can  convert  Stereo  2.0  to  5.1  surround  sound.  Full  discussion  about  script.  They  use  MVSep  to  get  steams  and  after  use  script  on  them.   -  Colab by  jazzpear96  for  using  ZFTurbo's  MSS  training  script.  “I  will  add  inference  later  on,  but  for  now  you  can  only  do  the  training  process  with  this!”   -  New  djay  Pro  5.0  has  “very  good  realtime  stems  with  low  CPU”  Allegedly  “faster  and  better  
than
 
Demucs,
 
similar”
 
although
 
“They
 
are
 
not
 
realtime,
 
they
 
are
 
buffered
 
and
