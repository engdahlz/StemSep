 “I  usually  use  big  beta  6x,  big  beta  5e  if  that  fails  and  FT2  bleedless  if  I  want  very  low  noise

  -  Anvuew  BS-Roformer  vocal  model  |  download Doesn't  work  on  the  UVR’s  RTX  5000  patch  -  then  use  MSST instead.  Can  be  muddy.  Not  so  balanced  like  Beta6X  or  vocfv7beta1,  but  “it  properly  doesn't  capture  the  instrument  here.  Even  FT2  bleedless  gets  tricked  by  this  part,  but  this  does  just  fine.”  -  rainboomdash   -  Unwa’s  BS-Roformer  Resurrection |  yaml |  Colab *  Vocal  bleedless:  39.99,  fullness:  15.14,  SDR:  11.34  Shares  some  similarities  with  the  SW  model,  including  small  size  (might  be  a  retrain).  The  
default
 
chunk_size
 
is
 
pretty
 
big,

if
