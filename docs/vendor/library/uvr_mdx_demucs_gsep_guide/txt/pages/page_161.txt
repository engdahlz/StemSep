    “picks  up  vocals  better  than  the  first  model,  but  along  with  the  vocals,  it  muffles  other  
instruments,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
synthesizer.”

 “The  model  files  (bs_roformer.py)  for  v2_voc  and  v2_inst  are  the  same.  (...)  The  aura_mrstft  score  was  further  improved,  and  the  SDR  also  increased.  (...)  Incidentally,  this  new  model  outperformed  v1e+  on  all  metrics.  (...)  holds  the  highest  
aura_mrstft
 
score
 
on
 
the
 
instrumental
 
side

 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/9475 “kept  the  chants  in  [one  song],  resurrection  inst  isn't  really  much  better,  though...  it  takes  a  high  vocal  fullness  model  to  extract  these  (like  fv7beta1,  even  fv7beta2  isn't  
enough),
 
maybe
 
that's
 
why
 
the
 
instrumental
 
models
 
are
 
getting
 
confused...
 
Surprised
 
it's
 
still
 
very
 
much
 
there
 
with

 I'm  surprised,  hyperacev2  fixed  vocal  bleed  on  one  song  compared  to  the  previous  version.  
Does
 
seem
 
like

bleed
 
with

is
 
a

better
 it's  not  removed,  just  quieter  in  areas  where  it  did  happen”  -  rainboomdash    -  Unwa  BS-Roformer  Resurrection  inst (yaml)  |  a.k.a.  “unwa  high  fullness  inst"  on  MVSEP  |  uvronline.app/x-minus.pro  |  Colab |  Kaggle |  UVR (don’t  confuse  with  Resurrection  vocals  variant)  Inst.  fullness:  34.93,  bleedless:  40.14,  SDR:  17.25  MVSEP  BS  2025.07  works  as  a  reference  for  phase  fix  with  3000/5000  settings.

 “One  of  my  favorite  fullness  inst  models  ATM.  Sounds  like  v1e  to  me,  but  cleaner.  Especially  
with
 
guitar/piano
 
where
 
v1e
 
tended
 
to
 
add
 
more
 
phase
 
distortion,
 
I
 
guess
 
that's
 
what
 
you'd
 
call
 
it
 
lol.
 
This
 
model
 
preserves
 
their
 
purity
 
better
 
IMO”

 “I  like  resurrection  inst  for  segments  of  piano,  a  lot  of  other  models  are  too  noisy  there  (...)  I  
also
 
needed
 
to
 
turn
 
overlap
 
up
 
for
 
piano”
 
(from

 “The  way  it  sounds,  is  indeed  the  best  fullness  model,  it's  like  between  v1e  and  v1e+,  so  not  
so
 
noisy
 
and
 
full
 
enough,
 
though
 
it
 
creates
 
problems
 
with
 
instruments
 
gone
 
in
 
the

it

 “it  seems  to  just  nip  some  bits  of  random  instruments  like  saxophone  or  guitar  whereas  v1e+  
leaves
 
them
 
intact.”

 “Some  songs  leaves  vocal  residue.  It  is  heard  little  but  felt”  -  Fabio  “Almost  loses  some  sounds  that  v1e+  picks  up  just  fine”  -  neoculture  Mushes  some  synths  a  bit  in  e.g.  trap/drill  tune  compared  to  inst  Mel-Roformers  like  
INSTV7/Becruily/FVX/inst3,
 
but
 
the
 
residues/vocal
 
shells
 
are
 
a
 
bit
 
quieter,
 
although
 
the
 
clarity
 
is
 
also
 
decreased
 
a
 
bit.
 
Kind
 
of
 
a
 
trade.
