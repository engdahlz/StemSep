    -WAV  bit  depth:  24  bit  PCM  -Nothing  else   Done!   +5.  You  can  check  your  work  by  opening  Audacity,  importing  the  exported  stems,  and  mixing  
them
 
together
 
by
 
pressing
 
CTRL+A,
 
going
 
inside:
 
Tracks

and
 
Render.
 If  everything  is  done  correctly,  you  should  have  a  mix  of  stems  which  sound  nice  to  the  ears,  
and
 
has
 
absolutely
 
zero
 
clipping.
 
You
 
can
 
if
 
it
 
clips
 
or
 
not
 
by
 
checking:
 
View
 
>
 
Show
 
Clipping
 
(on/off).
 
Or
 
you
 
can
 
press
 
CTRL+A,
 
go
 
inside
 
Effects
 
>
 
Volume
 
and
 
Compression
 
>
 
Amplify.
 
If
 
it's
 
correct,
 
the

  Clipping  bug  workaround  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/708579735583588366/1139206772092051496/Instrumental_Fix.mp4 In  addition  to  Safe  Mode,  I  set  the  release  to  the  max,  and  it  worked  that  way,  but  the  
dynamic
 
were
 
shite.

any
 
sidechain
 
limiter
 
for
 
that
 
matter.
 
This
 
is
 
just
 
how
 
digital
 
audio
 
works,
 
unfortunately.
 (And  PS.  -  32-bit  float  exporting  might  prevent  clipping).   Trivia   Ugggh,  just  checked  out  both  Pedalboard,  and  DawDreamer,  from  what  it  looks  like:  It's  not  
really
 
possible
 
to
 
recreate
 
stem
 
limiting
 
with
 
a
 
RAM
 
loaded
 
mixture
 
as
 
a
 
reference/auxiliary
 
input.
 
 The  only  2  remaining  possibilities  that  I  am  thinking  of  is  using  pydub,  librosa,  scipy  or  pyo  to  
do
 
it
 
without
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
a
 
DAW.
 If  that's  not  possible,  then  the  only  option  left  is  to  control  REAPER  with  reapy  +  reascript.   I  also  think  I  now  understand  why  the  peak  amplitude  of  the  instrumental  is  decreased  when  
you
 
re-mix
 
the
 
acapella
 
back
 
in
 
to
 
the
 
mix:
  Since  music  is  basically  just  about,  22000  different  sine  wavs  going  off  at  the  exact  same  
time
 
with
 
changing
 
amplitudes,
 
the
 
pressure
 
waves
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
sine
 
waves
 
interfere
 
each
 
other
 
constantly:
  If  at  any  given  time  the  pressure  waves  of  these  sine  waves  have  a  perfectly  aligned  value  of  
+1,
 
then
 
they
 
add
 
up
 
together,
 
creating
 
a
 
strong
 
signal
