      Warning.  If  you  upload  lots  of  music  in  on  our  server  (or  any  other  server),  recently  
our
 
long-term
 
users
 
receive
 
warnings
 
from
 
Discord
 
about
 
possible
 
deletion
 
of
 
their
 
accounts
 
and
 
whole

got
 
deleted
 
-
 
we
 
advise
 
sharing
 
only
 
links
 
to
 
e.g.
 
GDrive
 
or
 
any
 
other
 
cloud
 
instead
 
of

So
 
far
 
our
 
user
 
received
 
two
 
warnings
 
from
 
Discord
 
without
 
deleting
 
account
 
yet.
 
The
 
whole
 
good
 
results
 
channel
 
got
 
deleted
 
after
 
linking
 
to
 
uploads
 
instead
 
of
 
uploading
 
after
 
the
 
last
 
clean-up
 
we
 
got.
 
Recently
 
we
 
added
 
bot
 
automatically
 
deleting
 
audio
 
files
 
uploaded
 
directly
 
to
 
Discord
 
instead
 
of
 
links
 
added
 
and
 
the
 
channel
 
has
 
been
 
reopened.
  
Training  models  guide   Read  mesk’s  guide (new  link  #2),  then  proceed  below  for  arch  explanations  and  more  details.   As  for  a  training  code  for  Roformers  and  MDX23C,  SCNet  or  adding  new  archs,  most  people  use  MSST by  ZFTurbo.  It’s  also  provided  with  bunch  of  documentation.  “You  can  start  with  Sucial  MSST  WebUI.  I  use  that  to  train  all  my  models”  -  Gabox   Introduction   
“There
 
are
 
three
 
components
 
to
 
the
 
model
 
scaling
 
laws.
 
 
They
 
are
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
set,
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
parameters
 
in
 
the
 
model,
 
and
 
the
 
computational
 
resources.”
 
unwa
 
For
 
training,
 
depending
 
on
 
model
 
type
 
(explained
 
above),
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
e.g.
 
three
 
files
 
for
 
training
 
e.g.
 
vocal
 
model
 
-
 
vocals,
 
instrumental,
 
and
 
mixture.
 
When
 
you’ll
 
try
 
to
 
train
 
without
 
mixture,
 
the
 
results
 
will
 
be
 
“terrible”
 
(iirc
 
it
 
was
 
said
 
somewhere
 
in
 
times
 
of
 
Mel
 
Kim’s
 
model).
 "You  can  train  any  sound  you  want  with  any  architecture  (MDX-Net,  Demucs,  Spleeter)"  But  don’t  use  Spleeter,  it’s  deprecated  since  so  many  archs  were  released  (Kim).  Just  be  aware  that  not  every  arch  is  a  good  choice  for  some  specific  tasks  or  instruments.   (Among  others,  the  following  based  also  on  Anjok’s  interview,  around  0:40:00)   For  training  a  new  model,  use  at  least  200  samples  for  such  a  model  to  achieve  any  good  
results.
 
Anything
 
below
 
that
 
might
 
give
 
you
 
the
 
results
 
you
 
might
 
not
 
be
 
happy
 
with,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
above
 
that
 
will
 
give
 
better
 
results.
 For  BS/Mel  Roformers,  525  songs  were  not  enough  to  train  a  good  model  from  scratch  at  
some
 
point.
 Q:  Anyone  know  how  many  songs  are  generally  needed  to  finetune  a  Mel-Roformer  model
