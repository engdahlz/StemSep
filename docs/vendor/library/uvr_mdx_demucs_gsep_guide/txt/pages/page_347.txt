    I've  reduced  [the]  UVR[’s]  window  while  the  download  was  ongoing  and  the  download  speed  
fastly
 
improved
 
instantly.
 I've  restored  the  window,  download  speed  was  again  instantly  slowed  down.  Re-reduce  UVR  
window,

  -  Official  UVR  requirements  from  GH  page:  Nvidia  RTX  1060  6GB  is  the  minimum  requirement  for  GPU  conversions.  Nvidia  GPUs  with  at  least  8GBs  of  VRAM  are  recommended.  Intel  Pentium  might  be  unsupported,  but  AVX  or  SSE4.2  instructions  are  not  required,  so  
even
 
newer
 
C2Q
 
like
 
Q9650
 
with
 
SSE4.1
 
will
 
suffice.
 
  -  2GB  VRAM  GPUs  had  some  issues  even  on  CPU,  maybe  it's  fixed  already   -   Official  minimum  RAM  requirement  is  8GB,  although  it  works  correctly  on  6GB  RAM  too.  
With
 
4GB
 
RAM
 
you
 
can
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
memory
 
on
 
longer
 
tracks
 
(probably
 
fixed
 
in
 
many
 
cases
 
in
 
the
 
v
 
5.5
 
and
 
newer
 
-
 
you’re
 
able
 
to
 
separate
 
Roformers
 
on
 
GPU
 
on
 
4GB
 
VRAm
 
with
 
2,5s
 
chunks).
  -  As  from  new  Nvidia  GPUs,  something  like  RTX  3050  (8GB)  is  a  good,  cheap  choice  for  
even
 
the
 
heaviest
 
processing
 
and
 
is
 
(theoretically)
 
equivalent
 
to
 
Colab's
 
Tesla
 
T4
 
for
 
CUDA
 
computing
 
power
 
(but
 
it's
 
not
 
really
 
enough
 
for
 
training,
 
of
 
course,
 
and
 
in
 
Colab
 
slower
 
like
 
3
 
times).
 
But
 
watch
 
out
 
for
 
smaller
 
4GB
 
laptop
 
variants,
 
as
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
more
 
problematic.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
separate
 
a
 
lot
 
using
 
Rofomers,
 
definitely
 
consider
 
something
 
better
 
(look
 
for
 
as
 
menu
 
CUDA
 
cores
 
as
 
possible)
  -  Sometimes  32/64  bit  float  output  set  can  trigger  “FileNotFoundError:  "[WinError  2]  The  
system
 
cannot
 
find
 
the
 
file
 
specified"”
  (troubleshooting  continues  later  beneath)   CPU/GPU  performance  in  UVR   -  The  higher  the  total  amount  of  CUDA  cores  for  Nvidia  GPU,  the  faster  separation  in  UVR   -  AMD  and  Intel  ARC  GPUs  using  OpenCL  are  slower  in  this  separation  task  than  CUDA  
used
 
in
 
Nvidia
 
GPUs.
 
So
 
it’s
 
safe
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
Nvidia
 
GPUs
 
from
 
the
 
same
 
performance
 
segment
 
will
 
be
 
most
 
likely
 
faster
 
for
 
separation.
  -  Min.  4GB  VRAM  GPUs  tested  (with  some  yaml  tweaking  for  Roformers  described  below),  
On
 
AMD,
 
16GB
 
VRAM
 
recommended
 
(so
 
no
 
modifications
 
are
 
required).
 
 
Min.
 
NVIDIA
 
Maxwell/900

the
 
minimum
 
requirement
 
(at

NVIDIA
 
GT
 
700
 
series
 
and
 
older
 
are
 
unsupported
 
returning
 
CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED).
 
For
