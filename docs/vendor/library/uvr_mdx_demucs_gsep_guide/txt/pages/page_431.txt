    Software  like  https://www.advancedrenamer.com/ can  be  useful  for  this”    About  The  Colab  produces  one  of  the  best  SDR  scores  for  4  stems  (maybe  with  slightly  better  
implementation
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
as
 
“Ensemble”
 
4/5
 
or
 
more
 
models,
 
although
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
24
 
or
 
32
 
bit
 
output
 
used
 
for
 
that
 
evaluation
 
which
 
increases
 
SDR
 
(jarredou’s
 
v2.3
 
evaluation
 
was
 
made
 
using
 
16
 
bit).
  In  version  2.4,  for  2  stems,  UVR/ZFTurbo/Viperx  following  models  are  used:   MDX23C  Inst  Voc  HQ/MDX-Net  HQ_4  and  voc_ft  (optionally)/VitLarge/BS-Roformer  and  for  4  stems:    How  MDX23  Colab  works  under  the  hood  in  2.3  iirc  (more  or  less)   -  MDX  models  vocal  outputs  (so  inversion  of  one  inst  model  there)  +  Demucs  only  
vocals>inversion
 
of
 
these
 
to
 
get
 
instrumental>demucs_ft+demucs
 
6s+demucs+mmi
 
to
 
get
 
remaining
 
3
 
stems
 
(weighted)
 
to
 
get
 
remaining
 
3
 
stems
 
(all
 
steps
 
weighted).
 
Something
 
in
 
this
 
recipe
 
could
 
be
 
changed
 
since
 
then.
 Or  differently  -  “The  process  is:  1.  Separate  vocals  independently  with  InstVocHQ,  VitLarge  (and  VOC-FT  as  opt)  2.  Mix  the  vocals  stems  together  as  a  weighted  ensemble  to  create  final  vocals  stem  3.  Create  instrumental  by  inverting  vocals  stem  against  source  4.  Save  vocals  &  instrumental  stems  5  (if  5).  Take  the  instrumental  to  create  the  3  others  stems  with  the  multiple  demucs  models  
weighted
 
ensembles
 
+
 
phase
 
inversion
 
trick
 
and
 
save
 
them.”
   Modified  inference  will  probably  work  locally  too,  e.g.  if  you  use  that 2.1  repo  locally  (and  probably  newer  too),  but  the  modified  inferences  from  jarredou  crashes  the  GUI,  so  you  can  
only
 
use
 
CML
 
version
 
locally
 
in
 
that
 
case.
 Usage:  python  inference.py  --input_audio  mixture1.wav  mixture2.wav  --output_folder  ./results/   To  separate  locally,  it  generally  requires  a  8GB  VRAM  Nvidia  card.  6GB  VRAM  is  rather  not  
enough
 
but
 
lowering
 
overlaps
 
(e.g.
 
500000
 
instead
 
of
 
1000000)
 
or
 
chunking
 
track
 
manually
 
might
 
be
 
necessary
 
in
 
this
 
case.
 
Also,
 
now
 
you
 
can
 
control
 
everything
 
from
 
options:
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
set
 
chunk_size
 
200000
 
and
 
single
 
ONNX.
 
It
 
can
 
possibly
 
work
 
with
 
6GB
 
VRAM
 
that
 
way.
 If  you  have  fail  to  allocate  memory  error,  use  --large_gpu  parameter.  Chunks  option  have  been  deleted  from  newer  Colab  options.   Jarredou  made  some  fixes  in  2.2.2.x  version  in  order  to  handle  memory  better  with  MDX23C  
fullband
 
model.
