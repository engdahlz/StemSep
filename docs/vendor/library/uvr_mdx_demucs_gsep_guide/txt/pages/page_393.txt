Or  for  less  bleeding,  but  a  bit  more  muffled  snare,  use  this  one  instead:  HP-4BAND-V2_arch-124m.pth  (model  available  only  in  Colab,  recommended    *on  slower  Tesla  K80  you  can  run  out  of  time  due  to  runtime  disconnection,  but  you  should

  Aggressiveness :  0.1  (pretty  universal  in  most  cases,  0.09  rarely  fits).   Or  for  more  vivid  snare  if  bleeding  won’t  kick  in  too  much:  0.01  (in  cases  when  it’s  more  
singing
 
than
 
rapping
 
-
 
for
 
the
 
latter
 
it
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
more
 
unpleasant
 
bleeding
 
(or
 
just
 
in
 
some
 
parts

 0.05  is  not  good  enough  for  anything  AFAIK.  high_end_process :  mirroring2  (just  ON  in  GUI)  (for  less  vivid  snare  check  “bypass”,  (not  “mirroring”  for  ensemble  -  for  some  reason  both  
make
 
the
 
sound
 
more
 
muffled),

  Other  ensemble  settings    -  For  clap  leftovers  in  vocal  stem,  check  out  this ensemble  settings.  -  For  creaking  sounds,  process  your  separation  output  more  than  once  till  you  get  there  with  this setting  -  Also  reported  clean  instrumentals  with  this setting   Make  sure  you  checked  separated  file  after  the  process  and  file  length  agrees  with  original  
file.
 
Occasionally,
 
the
 
result
 
file
 
can
 
be
 
cut
 
in
 
the
 
middle,
 
and
 
you’ll
 
need
 
to
 
start
 
isolation
 
again.
 
Also,
 
you
 
can
 
accidentally
 
start
 
isolation
 
before
 
uploading
 
of
 
source
 
file
 
is
 
finished.
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
cut

  It  takes  45  minutes  using  Tesla  T4  (~RTX  3050  in  CUDA  benchmarks)  for  these  4  models
