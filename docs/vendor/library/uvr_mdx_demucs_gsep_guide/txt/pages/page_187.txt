     0d)  Aname  Mel  model trained  from  scratch  a.k.a.  Full  Scratch  Inst.  fullness:  25.10,  bleedless:  37.13    Models  for  older  archs   0c)  MDX23C  1666  model  exclusively  on  mvsep.com   (vocal  Roformers  are  much  more  muddy  than  MDX23C/MDX-Net  in  general,  but  can  be  cleaner)   0c)  MDX23C  1648  model  in  UVR  5  GUI  (a.k.a.  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ  /  8K  FFT)  and  
mvsep.com,
 
also
 
on
 
x-minus.pro/uvronline.app
 Both  sometimes  have  more  bleeding  vs  MDX-Net  HQ_3,  but  also  less  muddiness.  Possible  horizontal  lines/resonances  in  the  output  -  fix  DC  offset  and  or  use  overlap  “starting  
from
 
7
 
and
 
going
 
multiples
 
up
 
-
 
14
 
and
 
so
 
on.”

  0c)  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ  2  -  VIP model for  UVR  5.  It's  a  slightly  fine-tuned  version  of  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ.  “The  SDR  is  a  tiny  bit  lower,  but  I  found  that  it  leaves  less  vocal  
bleeding.”
 
~Anjok
 It’s  not  always  the  case,  sometimes  it  can  be  even  the  opposite,  but  as  always,  all  may  
depend
 
on
 
a
 
specific
 
song.
 
 0d)  MDX-Net  HQ_4/3/2  (UVR/MVSEP/x-minus/Colab/alt)  -  small  amounts  of  vocal  residues  at  times,  while  not  muffling  the  sound  too  much  like  in  old  BS-Roformer  v2  (2024.02)  on  
MVSEP,
 
although
 
it
 
still
 
can
 
be
 
muddy
 
at
 
times
 
(esp.
 
vs
 
MDX23C
 
HQ
 
models),
 
HQ_4
 
tends
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
least
 
muddy
 
out
 
of
 
all
 
HQ_X
 
models
 
(although
 
not
 
always),
 
and
 
is
 
faster
 
than
 
HQ_3
 
and
 
below,
 
it
 
tends
 
to
 
have
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
vs
 
MDX23C.
 Final  MDX-Net  HQ_5  seems  to  be  muddier  for  instrumentals,  although  slightly  less  noisy,  but  
better
 
for
 
vocals
 
than
 
HQ_4.
  0d)  MDX  HQ_5  final  model  in  UVR  (available  in  its  Download  center  and  Colab)  Versus  HQ_4,  less  vocal  residues,  but  also  muddier  at  times  and  a  bit  lower,  21,5kHz  cutoff.   
Sometimes
 
even
 
more
 
muddy
 
than
 
narrowband
 
inst
 
3
 
to
 
the
 
point
 
it
 
can
 
spoil
 
some
 
hi
 
hats
 
occasionally.
 
Versus
 
unwa’s
 
v1e
 
“HQ5
 
has
 
less
 
bleed
 
but
 
is
 
prone
 
to
 
dips
 
in
 
certain
 
situations.
 
(...)
 
Unwa
 
has
 
more
 
stability,
 
but
 
the
 
faint
 
bleed
 
is
 
more
 
audible.
 
So
 
I'd
 
say
 
it's
 
situational.
 
Use
 
both.
 
(...)
 
Splice
 
the
 
two
 
into
 
one
 
track
 
depending
 
on
 
which
 
part
 
works
 
better
 
in
 
whichever
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
song
 
is
 
what
 
I'd
 
do.”
