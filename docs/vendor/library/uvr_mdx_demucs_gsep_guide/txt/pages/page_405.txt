copy
 
vocals.onnx
 (use  the  same  models.py  from  point  3):  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exdP1CkpYHUuKsaz-gApS-0O1EtB0S82?usp=sharing to  onnx  subfolder  named  "MDX-UVR-Kim  Vocal  Model  (old)"   6)  For  496  inst  model  (inst  main/MDX  2.1)  go  to  the  link  below  and  put  the  model  to  
onnx
 
subfolder
 
named
 
“
MDX-UVR
 
Ins
 
Model
 
496
 
-
 
inst
 
main-MDX
 
2.1
”
 
but
 
you
 
must
 
replace
 
attached
 
models.py
 
in
 
the
 
link
 
in
 
your
 
GDrive
 
(it’s
 
from
 
the
 
OG
 
HV
 
Colab),
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
incompatible
 
with
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
models
 
in
 
this
 
new
 
Colab
 
-
 
make
 
a
 
copy/rename
 
the
 
previous
 
models.py
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
go
 
back
 
to
 
it
 
 (496  model  is  not  as  effective  as  464/inst3  leaving  more  vocal  residues  in  some  
cases,
 
but
 
might
 
work
 
well
 
in
 
specific
 
scenarios).
 
496
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
model
 
requiring
 
the
 
old
 
models.py
 
from
 
9.7/NET1-3
 
models
 
(attached
 
below).
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iI_Zvc506xUv_58_GPHfVKpxmCIDfGhx?usp=share_link (if  you  place  model  in  the  wrong  place,  you’ll  get  missing  vocals.onnx  error  [e.g.  wrong  folder  structure  or  name]  or  “Got  invalid  dimensions  for  input:  input  for  the  
following
 
indices
 
index:
 
2
 
Got:
 
3072
 
Expected:
 
2048.”
 
[when
 
having
 
wrong
 
models.py])
 7)  Demucs  turned  on  works  only  with  default  mixing  algorithm  and  vocal  models  (or  else  
you’ll
 
get
 
“ValueError:
 
operands
 
could
 
not
 
be
 
broadcast
 
together
 
with
 
shapes
 
(8886272,2)
 
(8886528,2)”).
 
Also,
 
chunks
 
might
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
decreased.
 8)  Be  aware  that  after  following  these  steps  if  you  launch  the  old  HV  Colab  above,  it  
may
 
overwrite
 
models.py
 
by
 
the
 
old
 
one
 
in
 
point
 
6,
 
which
 
is
 
compatible
 
only
 
with
 
inst
 
main/496
 
or
 
full
 
band
 
models,
 
so
 
you'll
 
need
 
to
 
repeat
 
step
 
3
 
or
 
10
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
invalid
 
dimensions
 
error
 
or
 
cutoff
 
of
 
full
 
band
 
model.
 9)  In  case  of  runtime  error,  to  use  Kim  model  decrease  chunks  from  55  to  50,  and  for  
Demucs
 
on,
 
decrease
 
it
 
to
 
40
 
(or
 
respectively
 
even
 
lower)
 10)  (beta)  Full  band  beta  292  model  (with  new,  only  working  for  that  model,  models.py  
file
 
with
 
self.n_fft
 
changed
 
to
 
6144).
 
 Go  to  the  link  below,  copy  model  file  to  onnx  subfolder  called  “MDX-UVR  Ins  Model  
Full
 
Band
 
292”
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
link,
 
and
 
replace
 
models.py
 
(ideally
 
make
 
a
 
backup/rename
 
the
 
old
 
one
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
use
 
previous
 
models)
 Thanks  for  help  to  Kim   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CTJ6ctldr_avwudua1qJJMPAd7OrS2yO?usp=sharing 11)  (beta)  Full  band  beta  403  model  (with  the  same  modified  models.py  for  these  two  
models)
 Copy  model  file  to:  Gdrive\MDX_Colab\onnx\MDX-UVR  Ins  Model  Full  Band  403\”  as  in  the  link  below,  
and
 
replace
 
models.py
 
in
 
Gdrive\MDX_Colab
