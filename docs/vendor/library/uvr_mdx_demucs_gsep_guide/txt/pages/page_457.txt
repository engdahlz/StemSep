days,
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
above
 
epoch
 
113
 
(perhaps
 
around
 
150,
 
it
 
wasn't
 
said
 
precisely),
 
while
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
config,
 
but
 
on
 
a
 
faster
 
GPU
 
(rented
 
2x
 
RTX
 
4090).
 
  Even  epoch  5  trained  on  jarredou's  dataset  casually  in  slow  and  troublesome  free  Colab  
(which
 
uses
 
Tesla
 
T4
 
15GB
 
with
 
performance
 
of
 
RTX
 
3050,
 
but
 
with
 
more
 
VRAM)
 
with
 
multiple
 
Colab
 
accounts
 
and
 
very
 
light
 
and
 
fast
 
training
 
settings,
 
already
 
achieved
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
Drumsep
 
using
 
smaller
 
dataset
 
and
 
older
 
architecture.
