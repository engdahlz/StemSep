“It’s
 
like
 
the
 
v1
 
model

phase
 
fixer,
 
but
 
it
 
gets
 
more
 
instruments,

choirs”.

not
 
working
 
that
 
well,
 
as
 
reverb
 
was
 
not
 
aligned
 
with

dry
 
audio
 
as
 
it
 should  have  been.”  jarredou  (more)   -  Aufr33  BS-Roformer  Male/Female  beta  (model |  config |  config for  UVR |  tensor  match  error  fix)  added  on  Colab (based  on  BS-RoFormer  Chorus  Male  Female  by  Sucial)  along  with  Unwa’s  Kim  FT2   -  Anjok  released  the  MacOS  versions  of  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #13.1  applying  hotfix  to
