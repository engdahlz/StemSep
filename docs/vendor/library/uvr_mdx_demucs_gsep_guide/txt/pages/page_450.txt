    you  need  to  pass  the  Volcengine  facial/document  recognition,  apparently  only  available  to  
Chinese
 
people
  We  already  evaluated  its  SDR,  and  it  even  scored  a  bit  better  than  Ripple  itself.   "API  from  volcengine  only  return  1  stem  result  from  1  request,  and  it  offers  vocal+inst  only,  
other
 
stems
 
not
 
provided.
 
So
 
making
 
a
 
quality
 
checker
 
result
 
on
 
vocal
 
+
 
instrument
 
will
 
cost
 
2x
 
of
 
its
 
API
 
charging.
  Something  good  is  that  volcengine  API  offers  100  min  free  for  new  users"   API  is  paid  0.2  CNY  per  minute.  It  takes  around  30  seconds  for  one  song.  It  was  1.272  USD  for  separating  1  stem  out  MVSEP's  multisong  dataset  (100  tracks  x  1  
minute).
  "My  only  thought  is  trying  an  iOS  Emulator,  but  every  single  free  one  I've  tried  isn't  
far-fetched
 
where
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
download
 
apps,
 
or
 
import
 
files
 
that
 
is"
  So  far,  Ripple  didn't  beat  voc_ft  (although  there  might  be  cases  when  it's  better)  and  Dango.    Samples  we  got  months  ago  are  very  similar  to  those  from  the  app,  also  *.models  files  have  
SAMI
 
header
 
and
 
MSS
 
in
 
model
 
files
 
(which
 
use
 
their
 
own
 
encryption),
 
although
 
processing
 
is
 
probably
 
fully
 
reliable
 
on
 
external
 
servers
 
as
 
the
 
app
 
doesn't
 
work
 
offline
 
(also
 
model
 
files
 
are
 
suspiciously
 
small
 
-
 
few
 
megabytes,
 
although
 
it's
 
specific
 
for
 
mobilenet
 
models).
 
It's
 
probably
 
not
 
the
 
final
 
iteration
 
of
 
their
 
model,
 
as
 
they
 
allegedly
 
told
 
someone
 
they
 
were
 
afraid
 
that
 
their
 
model
 
will
 
leak,
 
but
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
first
 
iteration
 
judging
 
by
 
SDR
 
with
 
even
 
lossy
 
input
 
files.
 Later  they  told  that  it’s  different  model  than  the  one  they  previously  evaluated,  and  that  time  
it
 
was
 
trained
 
with
 
lossy
 
128kbps
 
files
 
due
 
to
 
some
 
“copyright
 
issues”.
  "One  thing  you  will  notice  is  that  in  the  Strings  &  Other  stem  there  is  a  good  chunk  of  
residue/bleed
 
from
 
the
 
other
 
stems,
 
the
 
drum/vocal/bass
 
stems
 
all
 
have
 
very
 
little
 
to
 
no
 
residue/bleed"
 
doesn't
 
exist
 
in
 
all
 
songs.
  It's  fully  server-based,  so  they  may  be  afraid  of  heavy  traffic  publishing  Ripple  worldwide,  
and
 
it's
 
not
 
certain
 
whether
 
it
 
will
 
happen.
