    1)  If  you  already  have  a  ready  video  which  is  not  just  a  one  frame  (e.g.  a  cover  all  over  
the
 
video),
 
download
 
MKVToolnix
 
and
 
replace
 
audio
 
track
 
with
 
lossless
 
one
 
instead
 
of
 
rendered
 
lossy
 
track.
 
You
 
will
 
avoid
 
recompression
 
or
 
reencoding,
 
unlike
 
it
 
is
 
during
 
rendering
 
normal
 
video.
 
 2)  If  you  can,  upscale  the  video  to  at  least  1440p  or  greater.  It  will  avoid  deferred  
transitioning
 
of
 
your
 
AAC
 
(16kHz)
 
audio
 
stream
 
to
 
Opus
 
(20kHz)
 
when
 
your
 
video
 
gets
 
popular,
 
or
 
it's
 
old
 
enough
 
(for
 
current
 
YT
 
audio
 
format,
 
check
 
statistics
 
for
 
nerds).
 
QHD/+
 
makes
 
your
 
video
 
play
 
in
 
better
 
Opus
 
codec
 
from
 
the
 
beginning,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
sound
 
better
 
than
 
after
 
deferred
 
transition
 
from
 
AAC
 
to
 
Opus
 
on
 
FHD
 
clip
 
(Opus
 
audio
 
streams
 
checksums
 
differs
 
in
 
FHD
 
and
 
QHD
 
videos
 
despite
 
the
 
same
 
video
 
source
 
file
 
and
 
most
 
likely
 
something
 
is
 
broken
 
on
 
YT
 
side
 
during
 
the
 
process,
 
though
 
both
 
Opus
 
files
 
are
 
20kHz,
 
so
 
the
 
file
 
in
 
FHD
 
is
 
not
 
recompressed
 
from
 
AAC,
 
perhaps
 
from
 
other
 
audio
 
file
 
created
 
during
 
YT
 
rendering,
 
but
 
not
 
from
 
the
 
source
 
video).
 3)  Alternative  -  if  you  have  just  one  image  to  make  a  video  of  it  (e.g.  cover),  make  sure  
it’s
 
at
 
least
 
1440p
 
or
 
greater.
 
If
 
not,
 
simply
 
upscale
 
it
 
(e.g.
 
XnView
 
has
 
some
 
basic
 upscaling  filters).  Then  place  the  image  nearby  this  batch  FFmpeg  script with  your  lossless  audio  files.  It  will  render  videos  with  the  same  audio  streams  like  original  
files,
 
but
 
muxed
 
into
 
your
 
output
 
MKV
 
files
 
(you
 
can
 
check
 
in
 
Foobar2000
 
for
 
Audio
 
MD5
 
comparison
 
or
 
by
 
using
 
AudioMD5Checker,
 
if
 
MD5
 
checksum
 
is
 
not
 
embedded
 
when
 
looking
 
in
 
F2K
 
file
 
properties)
 
so
 
it
 
won’t
 
be
 
recompressed
 
on
 
your
 
end
 
while
 
making
 
a
 
video
 
for
 
upload
 
on
 
YT
 
(yes,
 
YT
 
supports
 
MKV!).
 
It’s
 
faster
 
than
 
MKVToolnix
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
convert
 
multiple
 
files
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
image
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
(it's
 
very
 
fast,
 
incomparable
 
to
 
normal
 
video
 
rendering,
 
and
 
output
 
is
 
only
 
1
 
FPS,
 
so
 
it
 
will
 
buffer
 
in
 
YT
 
also
 
very
 
fast).
 4)  You  don’t  have  to  wait  till  YT  stop  processing  your  HD  version  for  Opus  to  appear.  It  
happens
 
at
 
a
 
point
 
when
 
FHD
 
resolution
 
appears
 
before
 
QHD
 
when
 
processing
 
is
 
still
 
in
 
progress.
 
So
 
check
 
it
 
out
 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time
 
before
 
you
 
hit
 
the
 
publish
 
button.
 5)  Because  Opus  is  16  bit,  and  your  input  audio  file  in  Matroska  container  might  have  
higher
 
bit
 
depth,
 
it’s
 
good
 
to
 
compress
 
your
 
input
 
file
 
to
 
Opus
 
VBR
 
128kbps
 
for
 
testing
 
purposes
 
to
 
check
 
how
 
it
 
will
 
sound
 
on
 
YT
 
(of
 
course
 
don’t
 
use
 
it
 
later
 
for
 
MKV
 
file).
 
Downsampling
 
performed
 
by
 
the
 
encoder
 
can
 
occasionally
 
introduce
 
some
 
unwanted
 
changes
 
to
 
the
 
sound.
 
It’s
 
the
 
most
 
noticeable
 
when
 
audio
 
input
 
is
 
64
 
bit,
 
but
 
smaller
 
can
 
be
 
still
 
good
 
enough.
 6)  YouTube  videos  from  early  2010  on  archive.org  have  192kbps  AAC  for  1080p  (example)  (thx  theamogusguy)  7)  If  you  deal  with  some  harshness  on  your  YT  audio  uploads  with  original  44kHz  
sample
 
rate,
 
consider
 
resampling
 
them
 
manually
 
to
 
48kHz
 
before
 
upload
 
using
 
e.g.
 
Izotope
 
RX
 
(smooth)
 
or
 
e.g.
 
dBpoweramp/SSRC
 
(F2K
 
plugin)
 
and
 
save
 
the
 
output
 
as
 
lossless
 
format.
 8)  Since  now  MVSEP  supports  batch  API  conversions,  you  can  use  Case  Changing  in  
Ant
 
Renamer
 
to
 
reestablish
 
uppercase
 
letters
 
to
 
song
 
titles
 
for
 
your
 
YouTube
 
uploads.
