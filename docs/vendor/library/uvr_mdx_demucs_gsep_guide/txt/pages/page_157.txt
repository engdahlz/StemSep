[page 157/642]
    -  Use  the  search  bar  in  Google  Documents,  not  the  one  from  the  browser  -  the  browser’s  search  won’t  
find
 
everything
 
unless
 
all
 
the
 
pages
 
were
 
shown
 
before
 
-
 
the
 
doc
 
is
 
huge.
 
 
 -  Sometimes  if  you  search  for  a  specific  keyword  in  the  mobile  app  and  the  result  doesn't  show  up,  
you
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
document
 
outline,
 
and
 
open
 
its
 
last
 
section
 
and
 
search
 
again
 
(so
 
the
 
whole
 
document
 
will
 
be
 
loaded
 
first,
 
otherwise
 
you
 
won't
 
get
 
all
 
the
 
search
 
results
 
in
 
some
 
cases).
 
But
 
it
 
might
 
happen
 
mostly
 
if
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
wrong
 
search
 
function.
  -  Make  sure  you've  joined  our  Discord  server to  open  some  of  the  Discord  links  attached  below  (those  without  any  file  extension  at  the  end).    -  Download  links  from  Discord  with  file  extensions  at  the  end  no  longer  work,  but  I  reuploaded  most  of  
the
 
important
 
links
 
already.
 
If
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
download
 
from
 
previously
 
shared
 
Discord
 
link
 
anyway:
 
1)
 
Join
 
our
 
Discord
 
server
 
via
 
invitation
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
document
 
2)
 
Delete
 
file
 
name
 
from
 
the
 
link
 
3)
 
Open
 
our
 
Discord
 
server
 
in
 
the
 
browser
 
4)
 
Leave
 
everything
 
in
 
the
 
link
 
before
 
the
 
first
 
slash
 
and
 
delete
 
the
 
rest
 
(so
 
channels\xxxx\
 
5)
 
paste
 
two
 
identifiers
 
divided
 
by
 
slashes
 
afterwards,
 
but
 
without
 
file
 
name
 
(so
 
channels\xxxx\xxxx\xxxx
 
-
 
where
 
the
 
last
 
two
 
are
 
taken
 
from
 
inactive
 
file
 
link)
 
*)
 
If
 
you
 
paste
 
offline
 
link
 
in
 
any
 
channel
 
on
 
the
 
source
 
server,
 
the
 
link
 
will
 
work
 
again
  -  If  you  have  a  crash  on  opening  the  doc  in  the  app,  e.g.  on  Android  -  reset  the  app  cache  and  data.  
Keep
 
the
 
app
 
updates
 
or
 
find
 
some
 
old
 
version
 
(e.g.
 
even
 
from
 
period
 
when
 
your
 
phone
 
was
 
released
 
or
 
uninstall
 
all
 
updates
 
if
 
it's
 
GDoc
 
is
 
your
 
stock
 
app
  -  If  it  loads  4  minutes/infinitely  in  the  doc  app,  update  your  Google  Docs  app  and  reset  the  app  
cache/data,
 
e.g.
 
if
 
you
 
started
 
to
 
have
 
crashes
 
after
 
the
 
app
 
update.
  -  You  can  share  a  specific  section  of  this  document  by  opening  it  on  PC  or  on  a  mobile  browser  set  in  
PC
 
mode
 
by
 
clicking
 
on
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
sections
 
in
 
the
 
document
 
outline
 
(or
 
hyperlinks
 
leading
 
to
 
specific
 
sections).
 
Now
 
it
 
will
 
add
 
a
 
reference
 
to
 
the
 
section
 
in
 
the
 
link
 
in
 
your
 
address
 
bar,
 
which
 
you
 
can
 
copy
 
and
 
paste,
 
so
 
opening
 
this
 
link
 
will
 
redirect
 
someone
 
straight
 
to
 
the
 
section
 
after
 
opening
 
the
 
link
 
(in
 
some
 
specific
 
cases,
 
some
 
people
 
won’t
 
be
 
redirected,
 
but
 
in
 
fact,
 
you
 
only
 
need
 
to
 
wait
 
a
 
few
 
seconds
 
after
 
the
 
first
 
page
 
of
 
the
 
doc
 
has
 
been
 
shown,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
proper
 
redirect
 
starts).
 Some  headers  not  referred  to  in  the  outline  are  also  set  in  a  way  that  when  you  click  them,  the  
address
 
bar
 
will
 
change
 
with
 
a
 
link
 
leading
 
to
 
that
 
specific
 
section.
 
Not
 
all
 
headers
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
doc
 
are
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
outline
 
to
 
preserve
 
better
 
readability.
   -  In  the  GDoc  app  sometimes  you  need  to  tap  “wait”  a  few  times  when  the  app  freezes.  Afterwards,  
searching
 
will
 
start
 
working
 
all
 
the
 
time
 
(at
 
least
 
till
 
the
 
next
 
time).
 
The
 
doc
 
is
 
huge
 
and
 
the
 
GDoc
 
app
 
on
 
at
 
least
 
low-end
 
Androids
 
is
 
cursed
 
(desktop
 
version
 
on
 
PC
 
behaves
 
the
 
most
 
stable,
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
decent
 
phones).
 
You've
 
been
 
warned.
  -  If  you  feel  overwhelmed  by  the  doc  size,  theoretically  you  can  load  the  doc  into  Google  Gemini  or  
Google
 
NotebookLM
 
and
 
ask
 
questions
 
from
 
there,
 
but
 
I
 
encourage
 
befriending
 
with
 
the
 
document
 
outline
 
and
 
the
 
content
 
of
 
an
 
interesting
 
section
 
yourself
 
-
 
asking
 
the
 
AI
 
chat
 
for
 
the
 
best
 
models
 
leads
 
to
 
hallucinating
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
and
 
providing
 
list
 
of
 
outdated
 
separation
 
models
 
from
 
this
 
doc.
 
Also,
 
they
 
all
 
miserably
 
fail
 
with
 
generating
 
model
 
and
 
config
 
links
 
from
 
even
 
cut
 
fragments
 
of
 
the
 
GDoc.
 
They
 
also
 
cannot
 
edit
 
the
 
document
 
directly
 
(unless
 
you
 
paste
 
the
 
text,
 
but
 
it
 
will
 
rather
 
delete
 
all
 
the
 
formatting
 
and
 
hyperlinks
 
which
 
are
 
essential
 
to
 
the
 
task),
 
maybe
 
Office
 
365
 
with
 
paid
 
subscription
 
is
 
capable
 
of
 
editing
 
docs
 
with
 
AI
 
directly
 
already.
