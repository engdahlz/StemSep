     “Q:  wouldn’t  it  be  possible  to  extract  anything  that  is  panned  to  a  specific  point  yk  like  extract  
anything
 
that
 
is
 
panned
 
100%
 
exactly,
 
or
 
anything
 
that
 
is
 
panned
 
80%
 
or
 
50%
 
etc,
 
would
 
that
 
not
 
be
 
possible?
 
 A:  Mashtactic  does  that  since  almost  20  years  now  (coupled  with  dynamics  and  EQ  filtering)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lDAY0va4VE  -  zplane  has  released  a  clone  recently,  but  it  doesn't  have  the  transient/sustain  filtering  iirc”  
(isling/jarredou)
 -  Also,  you  can  use  AudioSourceRE  RePAN  for  center  extraction  as  well  (IncT)  -  Or  less  complex  free/paid  Bertom  Phantom  Center  (sometimes  it’s  better,  sometimes  worse  
than
 
MDX23C
 
model).
 
“Bertom
 
Audio
 
claim
 
to
 
not
 
use
 
basic
 
mid/side
 
processing
 
to
 
extract
 
the
 
center
 
so
 
probably
 
uses
 
decorrelation
 
on
 
the
 
sides
 
instead
 
of
 
mid/side
 
processing
 
which
 
by
 
its
 
nature
 
negatively
 
correlates
 
them.
 
The
 
net
 
result
 
of
 
Bertom
 
is
 
the
 
sides
 
are
 
decorrelated
 
from
 
the
 
center
 
and
 
so
 
are
 
maintained
 
more
 
strongly
 
in
 
the
 
stereo
 
field.”

 -   AOM  Stereo  Imager  D “turn  off  auto-gain  &  turn  down  center”  -  Reaper  guide   Hints  on  using  similarity  models   Q:  “Hi  there!  I  have  a  question  regarding  audio  separation  in  movies.  I  have  an  old  movie  
with
 
a
 
stereo
 
track
 
in
 
English,
 
and
 
a
 
mono
 
(!)
 
track
 
in
 
French.
 
I
 
couldn't
 
for
 
the
 
life
 
of
 
me
 
find
 
anything
 
better
 
than
 
mono
 
for
 
my
 
native
 
language,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
shame
 
(even
 
a
 
source
 
with
 
supposedly
 
stereo
 
French
 
is
 
actually
 
mono,
 
you
 
hear
 
it
 
right
 
away).
  So  I'm  willing  to  try  and  use  the  English  track  to  reinject  some  stereo  in  the  background,  to  
widen
 
the
 
music
 
and
 
sfx
 
at
 
least
 
(the
 
voices
 
being
 
centered
 
don't
 
bother
 
me).
 
i.e.
 
I
 
could
 
separate
 
the
 
voices
 
from
 
the
 
rest
 
in
 
both
 
languages,
 
then
 
mix
 
the
 
French
 
voices
 
with
 
the
 
English
 
sfx
 
and
 
music.
 
Whatever
 
artifacts
 
remaining
 
could
 
blend
 
enough
 
that
 
it
 
wouldn't
 
be
 
noticeable...
 
Maybe...
  How  would  you  guys  go  about  it?  I've  used  UVR  in  the  past  but  only  on  music,  not  movies  –  
and
 
it
 
was
 
months
 
ago.
 
Also
 
my
 
GPU
 
is
 
old
 
(Nvidia
 
GTX
 
970
 
with
 
4
 
GB
 
VRAM)
 
so
 
this
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
limitation.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
any
 
advice
 
you
 
can
 
give
 
me!”
  A:  “If  the  French  rip  is  a  downmix  between  stereo  channels,  then  you  don't  have  to  separate  
dialogue
 
in
 
the
 
French
 
rip.
  
Only
 
separate
 
the
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
English
 
version,
 
encode
 
it
 
to
 
mid/side,
 
replace
 
the
 
mid
 
channel
 
with
 
the
 
French
 
rip,
 
decode
 
back
 
to
 
stereo,
 
and
 
you're
 
done.
 
English
 
vocal
 
separation
 
will
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
the
 
stereo
 
bits
 
from
 
the
 
side
 
channel,
 
so
 
you
 
won't
 
be
 
hearing
 
both
 
languages
 
at
 
once.
 
Obv
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
align
 
the
 
sources
 
too,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
tricky
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
any
 
changes
 
in
 
timing
 
between
 
the
 
versions.
 
If
 
the
 
French
 
rip
 
is
 
only
 
a
 
single
 
channel
 
from
 
source
 
stereo,
 
then
 
do
 
your
 
way
 
of
 
isolating
 
both
 
languages.
