    Before  the  master  bus  is  the  limiter  plugin,  which  works  with  4-channels.  After  rendering  a  
pair
 
for
 
one
 
dataset
 
(in
 
this
 
case,
 
for
 
Karokee),
 
I
 
swap
 
audio
 
items
 
and
 
render
 
the
 
pairs
 
for
 
other
 
datasets:
 
BVE,
 
Strings,
 
etc."
  “For  training,  just  make  sure  that  all  pairs  have  a  margin  of  about  0.3  dB.  Storing  pairs  larger  
than
 
16
 
bits
 
can
 
be
 
useful
 
for
 
further
 
editing.”

Local  SDR  testing  script   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC9pwch0WQXZXwBNTz_QnXE_UyxdKmQF/view?usp=sharing by  Dill  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BeqNw3TnRTDMwnoQGMbOqwrcGRwe4Zht/view?usp=sharing GUI  by  zmis  (but  it  scores  a  bit  lower  for  some  reason):   “Here's  a  handy  little  python  script  I  made  using  the  help  of  Ai  that  can  calculate  the  SDR  of  
a
 
track
 
based
 
off
 
of
 
the
 
actual
 
instrumental
 
or
 
vocal
 
of
 
the
 
song.
  You  can  do  python  sdr.py  --help  for  an  explanation  on  how  to  use  the  script.   You  just  need  numpy  and  scipy  for  it  to  work,  and  python  ofc!   I'm  not  sure  if  you  would  like  to  pin  this  or  not,  but  I've  been  using  this  script  to  help  me  
improve
 
my
 
separation
 
methods.

(song_006)   A:  SDR  and  SISDR  behave  weirdly  when  1  of  the  input  is  silent,  and  that's  why  log_WMSE  was  made:  https://github.com/crlandsc/torch-log-wmse/  Interestingly,  L1freqMag  metrics  is  giving  same  results  than  some  users  here  (1296  a  bit  
better
 
for
 
instrumentals,
 
1297
 
a
 
bit
 
better
 
for
 
vocals).”
