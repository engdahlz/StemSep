[page 415/642]
     To  use  the  best  Demucs  4  model  in  the  official  Colab  (the  2nd  link)  rename  model  to  e.g.  
“htdemucs_ft”.
 
It
 
can
 
behave
 
better
 
than
 
6
 
stems
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
need
 
extra
 
stems.
 In  other  cases,  extra  stems  will  sound  better  in  the  mix,  although  using  6s  model,  vocal  
residues
 
are
 
usually
 
louder
 
than
 
in
 
ft
 
model
 
(but
 
that
 
might
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
or
 
genre).
  Despite  the  fact  that  6s  is  an  electric  guitar  model,  it  can  also  pick  up  acoustic  guitar  very  
well
 
in
 
some
 
songs.
  The  problem  with  6s  models  is  that  “when  a  song  has  a  piano  because  not  only  the  piano  
model
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
best,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
makes
 
the
 
sound
 
itself
 
worse
 rather  than  just  very  filtered  piano,  it  sounds  like  distorted  filtered  piano”   Sometime  Gsep  can  be  “still  better  because  each  stem  has  its  dedicated  model"  but  it  
depends
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
(other
 
stem
 
in
 
GSep
 
can
 
be
 
better
 
more
 
frequently,
 
but
 
now
 
MDX23
 
jarredou
 
fork
 
or
 
Ensemble
 
models
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
returns
 
good
 
other
 
stems
 
as
 
well)
 Gsep  instead  of  inverting  the  whole  result  among  stems  like  Demucs,  won’t  preserve  all  the  
instruments
 
occasionally.
  "htdemucs  (demucs  4)  comes  a  bit  closer  [vs  Gsep],  most  of  the  time  the  bass  is  better  and  
there
 
are
 
few
 
instances
 
where
 
demucs
 
picks
 
up
 
drums
 
better"
  “From  my  experience  and  testing:  If  you  decide  to  process  an  isolated  track  through  
Demucs,
 
it
 
has
 
no
 
trouble
 
identifying
 
what
 
is
 
bass
 
guitar
 
and
 
what
 
isn't
 
bass
 
guitar
 
[does
 
not
 
matter
 
if
 
it's
 
finger/pick/slap,
 
it
 
works
 
on
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
for
 
me,
 
except
 
distorted
 
wah-wah
 
bass].
 
The
 
leftover
 
noise
 
[the
 
part's
 
that
 
demucs
 
did
 
not
 
pick
 
up,
 
and
 
left
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
(No
 
Bass)
 
stem]
 
is
 
usually
 
lower
 
than
 
minus
 
40
 
-
 
45
 
DB,
 
and
 
it's
 
either
 
noise,
 
or
 
hisses
 
usually.
  The  problem  comes  when  there  are  instruments  besides  the  bass  guitar  that  are  playing  
beside
 
it
 
[a.k.a.
 
music],
 
since
 
these
 
are
 
separation
 
models,
 
not
 
identification
 
models.
 
It
 
starts
 
having
 
trouble
 
grabbing
 
all
 
the
 
upper
 
harmonics
 
[which
 
is
 
the
 
multiple
 
of
 
the
 
root
 
note
 
frequency],
 
and
 
the
 
transients,
 
potentially
 
starts
 
mis-detecting,
 
or
 
in
 
extreme
 
cases,
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
pick
 
up
 
the
 
bass
 
at
 
all.”
   “When  used  with  "--shifts"  >  0,  demucs  gives  slightly  different  results  each  time  you  use  it,  
that
 
can
 
also
 
explain
 
some
 
little
 
score
 
differences”
 
 https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs/issues/381#issuecomment-1262848601  Initially,  Shifts  10  was  considered  as  max,  but  it  turned  out  20  can  be  used.   Overlap  0.75  is  max  before  it  gets  very  slow  (and  0.95  when  it  becomes  overkill).
