[page 418/642]
    It's  to  pad  the  full  song  with  a  silent  of  a  random  length  between  0  and  0.5  sec.  Each  shift  
add
 
a
 
pass
 
with
 
a
 
different
 
random
 
length
 
of
 
silence
 
added
 
before
 
the
 
song.
 
When
 
all
 
shifts
 
are
 
done
 
(and
 
silences
 
removed),
 
the
 
results
 
are
 
merged
 
and
 
averaged.
  Shifts  is  performing  lower  than  overlap  because  it  is  limited  to  that  0.5  seconds  max  value  of  
shifting,
 
when
 
overlap
 
is
 
shifting
 
progressively
 
across
 
the
 
whole
 
song.
 
Both
 
works
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
shifting
 
the
 
starting
 
point
 
of
 
the
 
separations.
 
(Don't
 
ask
 
me
 
why
 
that
 
works!)
  But  overlap  with  high  values  is  kinda  biased  towards  the  end  of  the  audio,  it's  caricatural  
here
 
but
 
first
 
(chunk
 
-
 
overlap)
 
will
 
be
 
1
 
pass,
 
2nd
 
(chunk
 
-
 
overlap)
 
will
 
be
 
2
 
passes,
 
3rd
 
(chunk
 
-
 
overlap)
 
will
 
be
 
3
 
passes,
 
etc…”
  So  Overlap  has  more  impact  on  the  results  than  shift.   “Side-note:  Demucs  overlap  and  MVSEP-MDX23  by  ZFTurbo  overlap  features  are  not  
working
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
way.
 
(...)
 Demucs  is  kinda  crossfading  the  chunks  in  their  overlapping  regions,  while  MVSep-MDX23  
is
 
doing
 
avg/avg
 
to
 
mix
 
them
 
together”
  Why  is  overlapping  advantageous?   Because  changing  the  starting  point  of  the  separation  give  slightly  different  results  (I  can't  
explain
 
why!).
 
The
 
more
 
you
 
move
 
the
 
starting
 
point,
 
the
 
more
 
different
 
the
 
results
 
are.
 
That's
 
why
 
overlap
 
performs
 
better
 
than
 
shifts
 
limited
 
to
 
0-0.5sec
 
range,
 
like
 
I
 
said
 
before.
 Overlap  in  Demucs  (and  now  UVR)  is  also  crossfading  overlapping  chunks,  that  is  probably  
also
 
reducing
 
the
 
artifacts
 
at
 
audio
 
chunks/segments
 
boundaries.
  [So  technically,  if  you  could  load  the  entire  track  in  at  once,  you  wouldn't  need  overlap]   Shifts=10  vs  2  gives  +0.2  SDR  with  overlap=0.25  (the  setting  they've  used  in  their  original  
paper),
 
if
 
you
 
use
 
higher
 
value
 
for
 
overlap,
 
the
 
gain
 
will
 
be
 
lower,
 
as
 
they
 
both
 
rely
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
"trick"
 
to
 
work.
  Shifts=X  can  give  little  extra  SDR  as  it's  doing  multiple  passes,  but  will  not  degrade  
"baseline"
 
quality
 
(even
 
with
 
shifts=0)
 Lower  than  recommanded  values  for  segment  will  degrade  "baseline"  quality.   So  in  theory,  you  can  equally  set  shifts  to  0  and  max  out  overlap.   Segments  optimum  (in  UVR  beta/new)  is  256.
