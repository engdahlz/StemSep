     -   Q:  When  ensembling  and  having  settings  test  mode  enabled,  UVR  keeps  all  the  different  
outputs
 
before
 
ensembling
 
in
 
a
 
folder.
 
If
 
you're
 
not
 
careful,
 
these
 
quickly
 
can
 
stack
 
up.
 [Is  it]  Possible  to  have  a  feature  where  UVR  automatically  deletes  those  after  ensembling?  A:  Disable  '*Save  all  outputs*'  in  *Ensemble  Customization  Options*  >  *Advanced  Option  
Menu*
 
is
 
what
 
you
 
ask
 
for.
  -  Performance  of  GPU  per  dollar  in  training  and  interference  (running  a  model):  click  -  How  to  check  whether  the  model  is  instrumental  or  vocal?  Q:  Are  VR  Arc  models  also  grouped  between  instrumentals/vocal  models,  or  it's  just  
MDX-Net
 
models?
 A:  The  moment  you  see  Instrumental  on  top  (and  Vocal  below)  in  the  list  where  GPU  
conversion
 
is
 
mentioned,
 
you
 
know
 
it's
 
an
 
instrumental
 
model.
 When  it  flips  the  sequence,  so  Vocal  on  top,  you  know  it's  a  vocal  model.   Same  happens  for  MDX  and  VR  archs.   Q:  [How  to]  have  UVR  automatically  deleting  the  ensemble  result  folder  after  processing  a  
song.
 A:  Go  to  settings,  ensemble  options,  uncheck  "Save  all  outputs".   -  You  can  perform  the  Manual  ensemble  on  your  own  already  separated  files  (e.g.  from  
Colab)
 
in
 
UVR5
 
under
 
"Audio
 
Tools”.
 
Just
 
ensure
 
that
 
files
 
are
 
aligned
 
(begin
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
place).
 
Sometimes
 
using
 
lossy
 
files
 
can
 
mess
 
with
 
offset
 
and
 
file
 
alignment.
 -  Furthermore,  you  can  use  Matchering  in  Audio  Tools,  e.g.  to  fit  muddy  results  without  
residues,
 
to
 
the
 
separation
 
with
 
more
 
clarity,
 
but
 
containing
 
residues
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
get
 
rid
 
of.
 
Just
 
use
 
file
 
without
 
residues
 
as
 
target,
  -  If  you  have  crashes  on  “saving  stem”  uninstall  odrive   -  Q:  An  option  to  add  the  model's  name  to  the  output  files  (this  existed  in  a  previous  version  
of
 
UVR
 
but
 
now
 
it's
 
gone)
 
it
 
was
 
really
 
useful
 
when
 
you
 
needed
 
to
 
test
 
multiple
 
models
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
song
 A:  It's  still  there  under  additional  settings  "Model  Test  Mode"   -  Q:  I  want  to  separate  an  audio  from  a  video  (input  is  still  empty  when  I  choose  a  file)  A:  Go  to  General  Process  Settings>Accept  Any  Input   -  Q:  First  time  trying  the  ensemble  mode  and  I  used  the  VR  Models:  "De-Echo-Aggresive,  
De-Echo-Normal,
 
DeEcho-DeReverb,
 
DeNoise"
 
now
 
the
 
outputs
 
confuse
 
me.
 
In
 
the
 
folder
 
called
 
"Ensembled-Outputs"
 
there
 
are
 
many
 
files
 
which
 
are
 
from
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
models.
 
Outside
 
that
 
directory
 
are
 
2
 
wav
 
files,
 
one
 
says
 
Echo
 
the
 
other
 
No
 
Echo.
 
Isn't
 
the
 
ensemble
 
mode
 
basically
 
a
 
wav
 
file
 
that
 
goes
 
through
 
each
 
model
 
and
 
saves
 
a
 
final
 
wav
 
file
 
after
 
it
 
went
 
through
 
all
 
the
 
models
 
listed?
