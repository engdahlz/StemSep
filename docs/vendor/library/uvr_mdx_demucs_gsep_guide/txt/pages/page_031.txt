Sounds  like  v1e  to  me,  but  cleaner.  Especially

 “the  way  it  sounds,  is  indeed  the  best  fullness  model,  it's  like  between  v1e  and  v1e+,  so  not

full
 
enough,

it

 “Some  songs  leaves  vocal  residue.  It  is  heard  little  but  felt”  -  Fabio  “Almost  loses  some  sounds  that  v1e+  picks  up  just  fine”  -  neoculture  Mushes  some  synths  a  bit  in  e.g.  trap/drill  tune  compared  to  inst  Mel-Roformers  like  
INSTV7/Becruily/FVX/inst3,
 
but
 
the
 
residues/vocal
 
shells
 
are
 
a
 
bit
 
quieter,
 
although
 
the
 
clarity
 
is
 
also
 
decreased
 
a
 
bit.
 
Kind
 
of
 
a
 
trade.
 So  far,  none  models  work  for  phase  fixer/swapper  besides  1296/1297  by  viperx  and  unwa
