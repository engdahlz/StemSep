     It's  free,  called:  "Ripple  -  Music  Creation  Tool"  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ripple-music-creation-tool/id6447522624 The  app  requires  iOS  14.1  (it's  only  for  iOS).  Output  files  are  4  stems  256kbps  M4A  (320  max).  Currently,  the  best  SDR for  public  model/AI,  but  it  gives  the  best  results  for  vocals  in  general.  For  instrumentals,  it  rather  doesn’t  beat  paid  Dango.ai  (and  rather  not  KaraFan  too).   "My  only  thought  is  trying  an  iOS  Emulator,  but  every  single  free  one  I've  tried  isn't  
far-fetched
 
where
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
download
 
apps,
 
or
 
import
 
files
 
that
 
is"
  Sideloading  of  this  mobile  iOS  app  is  possible  on  at  least  M1  Macs.   "If  you're  desperate,  you  can  rent  an  M1  Mac  on  Scaleway  and  run  the  app  through  that  for  $0.11  an  hour  using  this  https://github.com/PlayCover/PlayCover"  IPA  file:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/z766tfysix5gt04/com.ripple.ios.appstore_1.9.1_und3fined.ipa?dl=0 "been  working  like  a  dream  for  me  on  an  M1  Pro…  I've  separated  20+  songs  in  the  last  
hour"
  "bitrise.com  claims  to  have  M1s  and  has  a  free  trial"   Scaleway  method:  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/708579735583588366/1146136170342920302/image.png “keep  in  mind  that  the  vm  has  to  be  up  for  24  hours  before  you  can  remove  it,  so  it'll  be  a  
couple
 
bucks
 
in
 
total
 
to
 
use
 
it”
  "I  used  decrypted  ipa  +  sideloadly  seems  that  it  doesn't  have  internet  access  or  something"   So  far,  Ripple  didn't  beat  voc_ft  (although  there  might  be  cases  when  it's  better)  and  Dango.  
Samples
 
we
 
got
 
months
 
ago
 
are
 
very
 
similar
 
to
 
those
 
from
 
the
 
app,
 
also
 
*.models
 
files
 
have
 
SAMI
 
header
 
and
 
MSS
 
in
 
model
 
files
 
(which
 
use
 
their
 
own
 
encryption),
 
although
 
processing
 
is
 
probably
 
fully
 
reliable
 
on
 
external
 
servers
 
as
 
the
 
app
 
doesn't
 
work
 
offline
 
(also
 
model
 
files
 
are
 
suspiciously
 
small
 
-
 
few
 
megabytes,
 
although
 
it's
 
specific
 
for
 
mobilenet
 
models).
 
It's
 
probably
 
not
 
the
 
final
 
iteration
 
of
 
their
 
model,
 
as
 
they
 
allegedly
 
told
 
someone
 
they
 
were
 
afraid
 
that
 
their
 
model
 
will
 
leak,
 
but
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
first
 
iteration
 
judging
 
by
 
SDR
 
with
 
even
 
lossy
 
input
 
files.
 Later  they  told  that  it’s  different  model  than  the  one  they  previously  evaluated,  and  that  time  
it
 
was
 
trained
 
with
 
lossy
 
128kbps
 
files
 
due
 
to
 
some
 
“copyright
 
issues”.
