    While  we  also  thought  overlap  0.99  is  max,  it  turned  out  you  can  use  0.99999  in  UVR,  and  
0.999999
 
in
 
CLI
 
mode,
 
but
 
both
 
make
 
separations
 
tremendously
 
long,
 
even
 
0.999
 
much
 
longer
 
than
 
0.99.
  On  GTX  1080  Ti  on  1  minute  song:  `0.99`   =  Time  Elapsed:  `00:09:45`  `0.999`  =  Time  Elapsed:  `01:36:45`   Also,  shifts  can  be  set  to  0.   With  htdemucs_ft,  shifts  doesn't  matter  nearly  as  much  as  overlap,  I  recommend  keeping  
(shifts)
 
at
 
2
 
[for
 
weaker
 
GPUs].
  The  drum  SDR  with  1  and  10  shifts  difference  is  about  0.005   So  overlap  impacts  SDR  a  bit  more  than  shifts.   “The  best  way  to  judge  optimum  settings  is  to  take  a  10-second  sample  of  a  vocal  extraction  
where
 
there's
 
evident
 
bleeding
 
and
 
just
 
keep
 
trying
 
higher
 
overlaps
 
etc
 
until
 
you're
 
happy,
 
or
 
you
 
lose
 
patience,
 
then
 
you'll
 
arrive
 
at
 
what
 
I
 
call
 
the
 
'Patience
 
Ratio'.
 
For
 
me,
 
it's
 
2x
 
song
 
length.”
   Installation  of  only  Demucs  for  Windows   Use  UVR,  or:  Download  the  git  repo,  extract  it,  then  open  PowerShell  and  write   "pip  install  *insert  the  directory  of  the  extracted  repo  here*"   https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs#egg=demucs  Alternatively,  execute  this  command:  pip  install  git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs#egg=demucs  or  download  the  git  repo  first  and  then   "pip  install  *insert  the  directory  of  the  extracted  repo  here*"  In  case  of  “norm_first_  error  run  this  line  or  update  torch  to  1.13.1  python.exe  pip  install  -U  torch  torchaudio    In  Colab,  judging  by  quality  of  drums  track,  I  prefer  using  overlap  0.1  (better  only  for  
instrumentals)
 
with
 
shifts
 
10
 
(actually
 
can
 
be
 
set
 
to
 
even
 
20),
 
but
 
default
 
set
 
by
 
the
 
author
 
is
 
0.25
 
and
 
is
 
better
 
for
 
sound
 
of
 
instrumental
 
as
 
a
 
whole.
