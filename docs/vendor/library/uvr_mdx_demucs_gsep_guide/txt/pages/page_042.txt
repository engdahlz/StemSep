    If  you  use  this  model  in  your  project,  please  credit  me.”  Should  work  in  UVR.  Just  place  the  model  file  in  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\VR_Models  and  config file  in  lib_v5\vr_network\modelparams.  Then  pick  “4band_v4_ms_fullband.json”  when  asked  to  recognize  the  model  (it  has  the  same  
checksum
 
as
 
in
 
lib_v5\vr_network\modelparams
 
folder
 
if
 
it’s
 
there
 
already).
 
Also,
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
not
 
VR
 
5.1
 
model.
 
And
 
it
 
was
 
used
 
with
 
vocal
 
model
 
as
 
preprocessor.
 More  about  its  usage  in  Karaoke section  (scroll  down  a  bit).   -  squid.wtf  doesn't  work  anymore  “it  just  downloads  30  seconds  of  a  song,  just  a  random  30  
second
 
snippet”

works.
 
  -  USS-Bytedance Colab  has  been  fixed  (Python  “No  such  file  or  directory”  fix)  -  thx  epiphery.  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rfl0YJt7cwxdT_pQlgobJNuX3fANyYmx?usp=sharing  -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  a  new  MVSep  Saxophone  (saxophone,  other)  model.  It  has  3  versions:   SCNet  XL  (SDR  saxophone:  6.15,  other:  18.87)  MelBand  Roformer  (SDR  saxophone:  6.97,  other  19.70)  Ensemble  Mel  +  SCNet  (SDR  saxophone:  7.13,  other  19.77)”  ZFTurbo  “SCNet  XL  take[s]  wurlitzer  as  sax  tho.

edit.
 
it
 
didn’t]
 Added  Lead  vocal  panning  setting  for  Mel-RoFormer  Kar  by  becruily  model.  [It’s]  “to  "tell"  the  AI    where  the  main  vocals  are  located  (how  they  are  mixed).  Added  Demudder  for  the  Mel-RoFormer  Kar  by  becruily  model.”  -  Aufr33  “doesn't  even  need  Lead  vocal  panning  a  lot  of  the  time,  [the]  ability  to  recognize  what  is  LV  
and
 
what
 
is

  -  Anjok  released  a  new  UVR  Roformer  patch  #15  fixing  CUDA  for  RTX  5000  Series  GPUs  
and
 
Windows
 
users
 
(it’s
 
based
 
on
 
CUDA
 
12.6
 
and
 
newer
 
PyTorch).
 
It
 
might
 
not
 
be
 
backward
 compatible  with  older  GPUs,  so  be  aware  (src).  Download  -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  becruily  Karaoke  model.  It's  available  as  option  in  MelBand  Karaoke

ZFTurbo
  -  (MVSEP)  Since  at  least  February  there's  a  normalization  for  all  input  unless  WAV  is  chosen  
as
 
output
 
format.
 Sometimesi  it  can  be  "annoying  when  you  have  to  combine  the  outputs  later".  “No,  if  you  turn  off  normalization,  FLAC  will  cut  all  above  1.0  And  if  it  was  normalized,  it  means  you  had  these  values.”  FLAC  doesn’t  support  32-bit  float,  it’s  32  int,  so  normalization  is  still  needed.”  So  if  your  stems  don’t  invert  correctly,  just  use  WAV  output  format  -  it's  32-bit  float.
