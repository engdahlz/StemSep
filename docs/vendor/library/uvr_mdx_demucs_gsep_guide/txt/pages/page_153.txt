    -  MDX23  4  stem  model  and  source  code with  dedicated  app  by  ZFTurbo  (3rd  place)  was  released  publicly  with  the  whole  AI  and  instructions  how  to  run  it  locally.  No  longer  requires

 better  SDR  than  demucs  ft).  You  can  still  use  the  model  online  on  mvsep1.ru (now  mvsep.com).   The  command:   "conda  install  -c  intel  icc_rt"   SOLVES  the  LLVM  ERROR   For  above,  you  can  get  less  vocal  residues  by  replacing  the  Kim  Vocal  1  model  there

 jarredou  forked  it  with  better  models  and  settings  already.   Short  technical  summary of  ZFTurbo  about  what  is  under  the  hood  and  small  paper.  From  what  I  see  in  the  code,  it  uses  inverted  vocals  output  for  instrumentals  from  -  Demucs

 MDX23 dedicated  section  of  this  doc.   -  jarreadou  made  a  Colab version  of  ZFTurbo  MDX23:  "(It's  working  with  `chunk_size  =  500000`  as  default,  no  memory  error  at  this  value  after  few  
tests
 
with
 
Colab
 
free)
  Output  files  are  saved  on  Colab  drive,  in  the  "results"  folder  inside  MVSep  installation  folder,  
not
 
in
 
*your*
 
GDrive."
  On  19.05  its  SDR  was  tested,  and  had  better  score  for  instrumentals  than  UVR5  ensemble  
for
 
that
 
time
 
being.
 
Currently
 
not,
 
but
 
there
 
are
 
new
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
Colab
 
planned.
  -  ByteDance-USS  was  released  with  Colab by  jazzpear.  It  works  better  than  zero-shot  for  SFX  and  “user-friendly  wise”  while  zero-shot  stil  better  for  instruments.  "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fel3hunq4eb83rs/AAA1WoK3d85W4S4N5HObxhQGa?dl=0 Queries  for  ByteDance  USS  taken  from  the  DNR  dataset.  Just  DL  and  put  these  on  your  
drive
 
to
 
use
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
Colab
 
as
 
queries."
 QA section  added.   -  The  modified MDX  Colab  -  now  with  automatic  models  downloading  (no  more  manual  GDrive  models  installations)  and  Karaoke  2  model.   >  Separate  input  for  3  models  parameters  added,  so  you  don’t  need  to  change  models.py  
every
 
time
 
you
 
switch
 
to
 
some
 
other
 
model.
 
Settings
 
for
 
all
 
models
 
listed
 
in
 
Colab.
 
From
 
now
 
on,
 
it
 
uses
 
reworked
 
main.py
 
and
 
models.py
 
(made
 
by
 
jarredou)
 
downloaded
 
automatically.
