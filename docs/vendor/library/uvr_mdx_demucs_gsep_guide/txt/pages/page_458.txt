    Purely  for  drums  separation  from  even  instrumentals,  the  model  might  not  give  good  results,  
hence
 
it
 
needs
 
separated
 
drums
 
first.
 
It
 
was
 
trained
 
just
 
on
 
percussion
 
sounds
 
and
 
not
 
vocals
 
or
 
anything
 
else.
  Also,  e.g.  the  kick  and  toms  might  have  a  bit  weird  looking  spectrograms.  It’s  due  to:  “mdx23c  subbands  splitting  +  unfinished  training,  these  artifacts  are  [normally]  reduced/removed  along  [further]  training.”  Examples  
Older  drumsep by  Inagoy   Demucs  3  model.  Just  remember  to  use  drums  in  one  stem  (e.g.  with  demucs_ft)  from

use

you
 
can
 
use
 
various
 
settings
 
for

to
 
get
 
better
 
instrumentals,
 
the
 
better
 
drums,
 
the
 
better

from
 
drumsep)
 
  -  Fixed  Colab  -  or  Kubinka  Colab (you  can  provide  direct  links  there)   -  Available  on  MVSEP.com  (but  you  can  use  more  intensive  parameters  in  Colab  for  a  bit  
better
 
quality)
  (Use  these  solutions  instead  of  GitHub  Colab  as  the  model's  GDrive  link  from  OG  GitHub  
Colab
 
is
 
currently
 
deleted,
 
so
 
drumsep
 
won’t
 
work
 
correctly,

"INPUT_FILE_PATH"
 
-o
 
"OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH"
 
  -  You  can  also  use  drumsep  in  UVR  5  GUI  (so  beside  using  fixed  Colab  or  in  CML):   Go  to  UVR  settings  and  open  application  directory.  Find  the  folder  "models"  and  go  to  "demucs  models"  then  "v3_v4"  Copy  and  paste  both  the  .th and  .yaml files,  and  it's  good  to  go.  Be  aware  that  stems  will  be  labelled  wrong  in  the  GUI  using  drumsep.   It's  much  more  sensitive  to  shifts  than  overlap,  where  above  0.6-0.7  it  can  become  placebo.  
Consider
 
testing
 
it
 
with
 
shifts
 
20.
 But  some  people  find  using  shifts  10  and  overlap  0.99  better  than  shifts  20  and  overlap  0.75.  _____________________  For  help  and  discussion,  visit  our  Audio  Separation  Discord:  https://discord.gg/ZPtAU5R6rP |  Download  UVR or MSST-GUI  For  inst/voc  separation  in  cloud,  try  out  free  Colabs:  BS/Mel-Roformer
