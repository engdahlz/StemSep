    question  or  password  without  being  redirected  to  their  page  and  having  to  log  into  the  
account
 
which
 
you
 
forgot
 
the
 
secret
 
question
 
(or
 
it
 
got
 
suspiciously
 
changed;
 
quite
 
honestly
 
-
 
I
 
got
 
it
 
changed
 
either
 
by
 
them
 
after
 
long
 
inactivity
 
of
 
around
 
2
 
years,
 
or
 
by
 
some
 
attacker
 
[but
 
it
 
would
 
require
 
secret
 
question]).
 
 5GB  
OneDrive
 
MS
 
have
 
taken
 
some
 
space
 
expansions
 
given
 
away

(some
 
older
 
accounts
 
might
 
be
 
still
 
bigger
 
than
 
that)
  5GB  Proton  Drive  End-to  end  encryption  working  also  for  sharing  (although  mega  has  probably  the  same)   
2GB

Temporary  file  uploads  that  expire  anytime  (by  HV):   https://litterbox.catbox.moe/ (don’t  confuse  with  catbox.moe)  (1  GB)  https://pomf.lain.la (512  MiB)  https://cockfile.com/ (128  MiB,  IK  funny  name,  but)  https://uguu.se/ (128  MiB)  https://sicp.me/ (114  MB)  https://www.moepantsu.com/ (128  MiB)   Hint.  In  the  case  of  some  free,  not  very  well-known  services  which  can  even  disappear  after  
some
 
longer
 
period
 
of
 
time
 
(do
 
you
 
remember
 
RapidShare,
 
copy.com,
 
hotfile

it’s
 
better
 
to
 
keep
 
your
 
files
 
in
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
service
 
(I
 
recommend
 
3
 
copies
 
for
 
important
 
data
 
kept
 
long),
 
or
 
stick
 
to
 
some
 
popular
 
big
 
tech
 
companies
 
which
 
are
 
unlikely
