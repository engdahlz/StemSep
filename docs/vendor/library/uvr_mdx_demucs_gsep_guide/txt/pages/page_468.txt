    It  was  possible  at  some  point  that  later  stages  of  the  training,  looking  like  over  fitting  were  
responsible
 
for
 
higher
 
frequency
 
output.
  It’s  sometimes  already  better  than  BVE  models,  and  the  model  has  already  similar  to  demo  
results
 
on
 
their
 
site.
  Sadly,  the  training  code  is  extremely  messy  and  broken,  but  a  fork  by  Cyrus  with  instructions  
is
 
planned,
 
with
 
releasing
 
datasets
 
including
 
the
 
one
 
behind
 
geo-lock.
 
Datasets
 
are
 
huge
 
and
 
heavy.
  Original  repo  (Vinctekan  fixed  it  -  the  video  at  the  top  contains  it)  https://github.com/jeonchangbin49/medleyvox  ____  Outdated   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1StFd0QVZcv3Kn4V-DXeppMk8Zcbr5u5s?usp=sharing (pip  issues  fixed  29.08.24,  defunct  as  of  06.02.25)   (outdated  instructions,  current  Colab  explains  everything)   “Run  the  1st  cell,  upload  song  to  folder  infer_file,  run  the  2nd  cell,  get  results  from  folder  
results
 
=
 
profit”
 
 
Further
 
explanations
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
Colab:
 
``Run
 
the
 
1st
 
cell``
 So  press  the  first  "play"  button  then  you  load  the  Colab  ``upload  song  to  folder  infer_file``  Looks  like  the  folder  for  the  input  file  has  changed  from  infer_file  to  input  in  newer  Colabs.  So,  once  you  started  the  first  cell,  and  it  finished,  open  Colab  file  manager  (folder  icon  on  the  
left)
 
and
 
go
 
to
 
/content/MedleyVox/input\
 Now  paste  your  song  there  and  wait  till  it's  done.  ``run  the  2nd  cell``  So  the  next  play  button  below  the  first  one  once  you  scroll  down  a  bit.  Now  it  will  start  
separation
 ``get  results  from  folder  results``  Go  to  file  manager  again  and  find  /content/MedleyVox/results  right-click  on  the  result  file  and  download  it.  Wait  till  it's  done.  ``Currently,  we  have  a  duet/unison  model  238  (default  in  Colab)``  So  you  don't  have  to  change  anything  in  the  Colab  to  separate  using  it.
