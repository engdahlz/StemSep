    -  Investigating  KaraFan  shapes  issue  >  link  -  New  piano  and  guitar  models  added  on  MVSEP.  Use  other  stem  from  e.g.  “Ensemble  8  models”  or  MDX23  Colab or  htdemucs_ft  for  better  results.   -  To  separate  electric  and  acoustic  guitar,  you  can  run  a  song  (e.g.  other  stem)  through  the  
Demucs
 
guitar
 
model
 
and
 
then
 
process
 
the
 
guitar
 
stem
 
with
 
GSEP
 
(or
 
MVSEP
 
model
 
instead
 
of
 
one
 
of
 
these).
 Gsep  only  can  separate  electric  guitar  so  far,  so  the  acoustic  one  will  stay  in  the  "other"  
stem.
  -  New  UVR  beta  patch  implements  chain  ensemble  from  x-minus  for  splitting  backing  and  
lead
 
vocals.
 
To
 
use
 
it:
 
  1.  Enable  "Help  Hints"  (so  you  can  see  a  description  of  the  options),   2.  Go  to  any  option  menu   3.  Click  the  "*Vocal  Splitter  Options*"  4.  From  there  you  will  see  the  new  chain  ensemble  options.   Patch (patching  from  the  app  may  cause  startup  issues)   -  "New  MDX23C  model  improved  on  [MVSEP]  Leaderboard  from  10.858  up  to  11.042"   -  "For  those  of  you  who  were  running  into  errors  related  to  missing  *"msvcp140d.dll"*  and  
*"VCRUNTIME140D.dll"*
 
after
 
installing
 
the
 
latest
 
patch,
 
it's
 
been
 
fixed."

 UVR_Patch_9_13_23_17_17_BETA  -  The  UVR's  latest  beta  9  patch  causes  startup  issue  for  lots  of  people  on  even  clean  
Windows
 
10.
 
No
 
fix
 
for
 
it.
 
Copying
 
libraries
 
manually
 
or
 
installing
 
all
 
possible
 
redistributables
 
doesn't
 
work.
 
In
 
such
 
case,
 
use
 
beta
 
8
 
patch.
  -  If  you  see  an  error  that  you're  disconnected  from  KaraFan  Colab,  it  can  still  separate  files  in  
the
 
background
 
and
 
consume
 
free
 
"credits"
 
till
 
you
 
click
 
Environment>Terminate
 
session.
 
It
 
happens
 
even
 
if
 
you
 
close
 
the
 
Colab.
 So,  you  can  see  your  GDrive  output  folder  still  constantly  populated  with  new  files,  while  
progress
 
bar
 
is
 
not
 
being
 
refreshed
 
after
 
error
 
of
 
runtime
 
disconnection
 
or
 
even
 
after
 
Closing
 
your
 
tab
 
with
 
Colab.
  -  KaraFan  got  updated  to  1.2  (eg.  model  picking  was  added).  Deleting  your  old  KaraFan  
folder
 
on
 
GDrive
 
can
 
be
 
necessary
 
to
 
avoid
 
an
 
error
 
now
 
in
 
Colab.
  -  KaraFun  -  next  version  of  MDX23  fork  (originally  developed  by  ZFTurbo,  enhanced  and  
forked
 
by
 
jarredou)
 
has
 
been
 
created
 
by
 
Captain
 
FLAM
 
(with
 
jarredou’s
 
assistance
 
on
 
tweaks).
