    Consider  changing  overlap  from  default  4  to  2  in  the  yaml  of  the  model.  The  difference  won’t  
be
 
really
 
noticeable
 
for
 
most
 
people,
 
but
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
faster.
 “thirty  minutes  of  audio  [on  4090]:  FNO  was  71.38  seconds,  HyperACE  was  120.37  so  HyperACE  is  about  2x  longer  than  FNO  (...)  Does  seem  like  HyperACE  is  picking  up  
more
 
instruments
 
than
 
v1e+
 does  seem  like  slightly  worse  vocal  bleed  overall  (still  need  to  test  this  more,  though)...  
haven't
 
encountered
 
the
 
super
 
tinny
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
like
 
v1e+,
 
at
 
least
 still  fails  to  pick  up  that  brass  instrument  on  one  song...  Not  really  any  worse  than  v1e+,  
though
 
(...)
 
resurrection
 
inst
 
does
 
sound
 
more
 
muddy,
 
but
 
also
 
a
 
lot
 
less
 
noise...
 
which
 
makes
 
sense...
 
IDK,
 
a
 
little
 
muddy
 
for
 
my
 
tastes.
 I  did  find  one  song/spot  and  resurrection  inst  was  on  par  with  HyperACE  in  picking  up  the  
wind
 
instrument,
 
v1e+
 
lost
 
it
 
for
 
a
 
bit.
 I  have  found  in  the  past  that  resurrection  inst  generally  picks  up  more  instruments  than  v1e+  
(...)
 
fullness
 
of
 
HyperACE
 
is
 
much
 
closer
 
to
 
v1e+
 
than
 
resurrection
 
inst
 
(...)
 
it
 
gets
 
pretty
 
staticy
 
compared
 
to
 
v1e+
 
[on
 
some
 
drums]
 
(...)
 
v1e+
 
does
 
this
 
to
 
a
 
lot
 
less
 
extent
 it's  not  super  common,  though…  (...)  I'm  very  confident  in  saying  HyperACE  picks  up  more  
stuff
 
than
 
v1e+.
 Resurrection  inst  does  pick  it  up  much  better  than  v1e+,  but  I  think  it's  still  too  quiet  resurrection  inst  really  does  just  pick  up  so  much  more  instruments,  despite  having  a  lot  less  
fullness”

 “the  best  instrumental  model  ive  ever  heard  Unbelievable  how  realistic  it  sounds  especially  with  bass  and  piano  -  PezZHasACat/pezz23  Might  have  problems  with  flute  in  specific  songs  -  Hen   -  (MVSEP)  “We  have  released  a  new  model  'MVSep  Lead/Rhythm  Guitar  (lead-guitar,
