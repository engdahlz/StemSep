    You  can  manipulate  with  weights  there  to  have  more  of  a  specific  model  in  the  final  result.  Default  settings  can  be  a  good  start.   Sometimes  you  might  want  to  disable  VitLarge.  Also,  some  people  like  to  increase  BigShifts  to  20  or  even  30  with  all  other  default  settings  
(some
 
songs
 
might
 
be
 
less
 
muddy
 
that
 
way),
 
 but  default  3  is  already  a  balanced  value,  although  exceeding  5  or  7  may  not  give  a  noticeable  difference,  while  increasing  separation  time  severely  over  default  settings.

   MDX-Net  Colab  by  HV All  older  notable  UVR-MDX  models  are  in  this  fork,  including  HQ_5  (don't  confuse  with

  MDX-Net  alternative  kae  Colab (fork  of  one  earlier  HV  Colab  version,  not  sure  if  it  still  works)  In  comparison  to  the  above,  it  has  the  old  min/avg/max  mag  mixing  algorithms  and  optional

   VR  HV  Colab (even  older  archs  with  even  more  residues,  no  de-echo  model  -  it’s  included  in  Not  Eddy’s  HF/Colabs  above)    Demucs  4  -  for  4  stems (lower  SDR  than  MDX23  Colab)  You  might  want  to  use  here  already  well  separated  instrumental  with  the  methods  above   Batch  separation  for  Demucs by  jarredou  (less  friendly  GUI,  but  should  be  usable  too)    older  Drumsep by  Imagoy  (newer  model  above  in  Music  Source  Separation  Colab)  -  kick,  snare,  hi-hat,  toms  (based  on  Demucs  v3)  -  also  use  on  already  separated  drums  from
