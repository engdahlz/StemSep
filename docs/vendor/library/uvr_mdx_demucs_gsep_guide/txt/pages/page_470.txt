    Stems  2.0   tensorflow  model  (which  can  be  found  in  newer  Virtual  DJ  2023  versions,  now  free  for  home  
users
 
-
 
better
 
than
 
Serato
 
and
 
Spleeter
 
implementations)
 
-
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
perform
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
best
 
offline
 
solutions
 
at
 
the
 
very
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
document.
 
But
 
“Esp.
 
since
 
it's
 
on-the-fly
 
[...]
 
results
 
are
 
more
 
than
 
decent
 
(compared
 
to
 
others).”
  Acon  Digital  Remix  (Vocals,  Piano,  Bass,  Drums,  and  Other)   “Just  listened  to  the  demo,  not  great  [as  for  realtime]  but  still”    Others  
FL  Studio  (Demucs)   It’s  actually  not  realtime.  It  takes  some  time  to  process  tracks  first  (hence  maybe  it’s  the  best  
out
 
of
 
the
 
three).
 It's  Demucs  4,  but  maybe  not  ft  model  and/or  with  low  parameters  applied  or/and  it's  their  
own
 
model.
 "Nothing  spectacular,  but  not  bad."  "-  FL  Studio  bleeds  beats,  just  like  Demucs  4  FT  -  FL  Studio  sounds  worse  than  Demucs  4  FT  -  Ripple  clearly  wins"   
djay  Pro  5.x    “very  good  realtime  stems  with  low  CPU”  Allegedly  “faster  and  better  than  Demucs,  similar”  
although
 
“They
 
are
 
not
 
realtime,
 
they
 
are
 
buffered
 
and
 
cached.”
 
but
 
it’s
 
very
 
fast
 
anyway.
 
It
 
uses
 
AudioShake.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
better
 
for
 
instrumentals
 
than
 
UVR
 
at
 
times.
  
Neutone  VST   Has  Demucs  model  to  use  in  realtime  in  a  DAW  (it  uses  light  “retrained,  smaller  version”  version  of  Demucs_mmi)  https://neutone.space/ https://neutone.space/models/1a36cd599cd0c44ec7ccb63e77fe8efc/  It  doesn't  use  GPU,  and  it's  configured  to  be  fast  with  very  low  parameters,  also  the  model  is  
not
 
the
 
best
 
on
 
its
 
own.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
give
 
decent
 
results,
 
so
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
stick
 
to
 
other
 
real-time
 
alternatives.
 
It
 
won’t
 
work
 
correctly
 
on
 
low-end
 
CPU,
 
breaking
 
audio
 
in
 
the
 
middle
 
and
 
giving
 
inconsistent
 
audio
 
stream
 
with
 
breaks.
