    Before  reopening  the  app,  go  offline  again,  open  the  app,  close  welcome  screen,  go  online,  
separate,
 
go
 
offline,
 
close.
 
If
 
you
 
happen
 
to
 
missed
 
that
 
step,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
start
 
from
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
instruction.
 
 (replacing  SettingsSDK folder  no  longer  works  after  transition  from  4.6  to  4.7,  it  freezes  the  app)   FYI  -  the  app  doesn’t  separate  files  locally.   -  Bas  Curtiz  found  out  that  decreasing  volume  of  mixtures  for  Ripple  by  -3dB  eliminates  problems  with  vocal  residues  in  instrumentals  in  Ripple.  Video.   This  is  the  most  balanced  value,  which  still  doesn't  take  too  many  details  out  of  the  song  due  
to
 
volume
 
attenuation.
 Other  good  values  purely  SDR-wise  are  -20dB>-8dB>-30dB>-6dB>-4dB>  /wo  vol.  decr.    The  method  might  be  potentially  beneficial  for  other  models  and  probably  work  best  for  the  
loudest
 
tracks
 
with
 
brickwalled
 
waveforms.
  
-  Stable  5.6  OpenCL  (DirectML)  version  of  UVR  5  GUI  for  Windows  
Supporting  AMD  and  Intel  GPUs  acceleration  but  no  Roformers  yet  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/download/v5.6/UVR_v5.6.0_setup_directml_old.exe Mac:  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/ (newer  beta  Roformer [with  “roformer”  in  the  installer  name]  supports  both  DirectML  and  CUDA  out  of  the  box  already;  for  Mac  M1  click).   -  For  CUDA  (NVIDIA  GPUs) -  non-OpenCL  installer  in  the  name  from  here:  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/download/v5.6/UVR_v5.6.0_setup.exe  (Following  based  on  previous  OpenCL  build)  8GB  VRAM  for  3:00/3:30  tracks  using  MDX23C  HQ  model  with  12GB  VRAM  probably  
enough
 
for
 
5:00
 
track
 
which
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
in
 
CUDA.
 Now  the  issue  should  be  mitigated,  and  less  memory  crashes  should  occur.   Ensembles  might  require  more  memory  due  to  memory  allocation  issues  not  met  in  CUDA  
before.
 
Also,
 
VRAM
 
is
 
fully
 
freed
 
only
 
after
 
closing
 
the
 
application.
  Acceleration  for  only  Demucs  2  (and  1?)  arch  on  AMD  is  not  supported.  All  others  archs  
should
 
work.
