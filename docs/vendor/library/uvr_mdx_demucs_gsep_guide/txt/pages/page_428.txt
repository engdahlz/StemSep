    -  “If  I  input  more  than  a  single  song  it  just  starts  building  up  on  model  data  without  clearing  
the
 
old
 
one,
 
so
 
it
 
slowly
 
starts
 
running
 
out
 
of
 
VRAM
 
and
 
then
 
gets
 
stuck”
   Experimenting  with  settings    -  Default  settings  of  the  Colab  are  a  good  starting  point  in  general   -  Some  people  like  to  increase  BigShifts  to  20  or  even  30  with  all  other  default  settings  
(some
 
songs
 
might
 
be
 
less
 
muddy
 
that
 
way),
 
but
 
default
 
3
 
is
 
already
 
balanced
 
value,
 
but
 
exceeding
 
5
 
or
 
7
 
may
 
not
 
give
 
a
 
noticeable
 
difference,
 
while
 
increasing
 
separation
 
time
 
severely.
  -  Switching  from  1296  to  1297  model  produces  more  muddy/worse  instrumentals  in  this  
Colab
 
(more
 
sudden
 
jumps
 
of
 
dynamics
 
from
 
residues).
 
Similar
 
situation
 
with
 
decreasing
 
BigShifts
 
to
 
1.
  -  voc_ft  enabled  might  give  less  muddy  results,  but  with  more  residues  in  instrumentals   -  In  2.5  you  can  try  out  the  following  settings  by  mesk:  “Set  the  weights  of  BS-RoFormer  &  MDX23C  to  0,  enable  VitLarge,  and  set  the  weights  of  
Mel-RoFormer
 
&
 
VitLarge
 
to
 
8
 
&
 
3
 
respectively.
 
 You  can  set  BigShifts  to  whatever  you'd  like,  I  think  5  or  7  is  optimal”  but  mesk  uses  even  9.  VitLarge  overlap  can  no  longer  be  changed  in  v2.5  of  the  Colab,  probably  only  in  CLI  
version.
  -  Or  you  can  test  ensemble  of  only  Kim  weight  10  +  Vit  weight  5,  BigShifts  e.g.  9   -  Or  BS-Roformer  with  MDX23C   -  Experimentally  set  “Separation_mode:”  to  4  stems  (slower)  and  "filename_instrum2"  will  be  
the
 
sum
 
of
 
the
 
Drums
 
+
 
Bass
 
+
 
Other
 
stems
 
that
 
are
 
obtained
 
by
 
processing
 
"instrum"
 
with
 
multiple
 
Demucs
 
models.
 
It
 
might
 
have
 
a
 
bit
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
or
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
muddier.
 
Vs
 
2.1

less
 
aggressive
 
as
 
its

for
 
some

to

  -  Increasing  overlap  might  give  muddier  results,  but  potentially  better  if  you  hear  some  vocal  
residues
  -  In  e.g.  older  v.  2.4  you  might  want  to  disable  VitLarge  to  experiment  (it’s  disabled  in  2.5)  -  
the
 
model
 
increases
 
some
 
noise
 
at
 
times
  -  Older  versions  than  2.4  have  very  clean  results  for  instrumentals,  although  it  can  rarely  fail  
in
 
getting
 
rid
 
of
 
some
 
vocals
 
in
 
quiet
 
fragments
 
of
 
a
 
track,
 
but
 
it
 
has
 
bigger
 
SDR
 
than
