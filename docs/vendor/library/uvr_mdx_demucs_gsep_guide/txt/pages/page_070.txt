call

 Since  then,  there  was  also  a  newer  MelBandRoformerBigSYHFTV1Fast model  released.   -  Lew  released  a  v2  of  the  vocal  enhancer  model  for  Apollo  trained  on  Roformer  vocal  
outputs
 Added  for  paid  users  on  x-minus  in  the  Ensemble  menu  or  in  the  Restoration  menu  (formerly  De-noise)  and  on  Colab.  Model  files |  config.  Works  the  best  potentially  on  BS  and  Mel  Roformer  ensemble,  but  it  might  add  some  noise  
as
 
well.
 The  model  stopped  progressing  during  training,  so  probably  there  won’t  be  any  newer  epoch  
of
 
this
 
model.
  -  Unwa  released  v2  version  of  the  inst  Mel-Roformer  model.  
“Sounds
 
very
 
similar
 
to
 
v1
 
but
 
has
 
less
 
noise,
 
pretty
 
good”
 “the  aforementioned  noise  from  the  V1  is  less  noticeable  to  none  at  all,  depending  on  the  
track”.
 
 “V2  is  more  muddy  than  V1  (on  some  songs),  but  less  muddy  than  the  Kim  model.  (...)  [As  for  V1,]  sometimes  it's  better  at  high  frequencies”  Aufr33  Also,  SDR  got  a  bit  bigger  (16.845  vs  16.595)  https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-Inst/tree/main |  Colab |  MSST-GUI  “It's  the  same  size  as  the  big  model  with  depth  12  and  mask_estimator_depth  3.  The  improvement  was  stagnant  with  the  same  model  size  as  v1.”  -  unwa  -  The  model  has  been  added  to  UVR  Beta  Roformer Download  Center  and  x-minus.   -  MSST-GUI  is  now  included  in  ZFTurbo's  repo,  it's  the  "gui-wx.py"  file”  just  don’t  run  it  by
