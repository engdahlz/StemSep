     Q:  Why  BVE  models  are  excluded?  [from  free  option]  A:  “Because  in  the  free  version,  wav  files  are  deleted  immediately  after  processing  is  
complete.
 
This
 
makes
 
it
 
impossible
 
to
 
download
 
some
 
stems.
 
In
 
addition,
 
this
 
model
 
necessarily
 
uses
 
MDX
 
for
 
preprocessing,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
compute-intensive.”
  -  (mvsep)  Bass  model  is  online.  The  metrics:   Single  models:  HTDemucs4  bass  SDR:  12.5295  BSRoformer  bass  SDR:  12.4964  MelRoformer  bass  SDR:  11.86  MDX23C  bass  SDR:  11.20   Models  on  site:  HTDemucs4  +  BSRoformer  Ensemble  (It's  available  on  site  as  MVSep  Bass  (bass,  other)):  
13.25
 Ensemble  4  stems  and  All-In  (from  site):  13.34   For  comparison:  Ripple  lossless  (bass):  13.49  Sami-ByteDance  v1.0:  13.82   -  GSEP  announced  works  on  a  new  model   -  Mel-RoFormer  Karaoke  model  added  on  x-minus.pro “one  of  the  cleanest  lead  vocals  result[s]”  “I  noticed  that  the  new  karaoke  model  considers  vocals  as  lead  vocals,  even  if  they  are  quite  
wide.
 
In
 
other
 
words,
 
it
 
has
 
a
 
much
 
larger
 
tolerance
 
for
 
vocal
 
width
 
than
 
other
 
karaoke
 
models.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
backing
 
vocals
 
that
 
sound
 
almost
 
centered
 
can
 
be
 
removed
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
lead
 
vocal.
 
If
 
I
 
apply
 
a
 
stereo
 
expander,
 
the
 
model
 
produces
 
more
 
adequate
 
results.
 
So
 
when
 
I
 
add
 
the
 
Lead
 
vocal
 
panning
 
setting,
 
the
 
"center"
 
will
 
actually
 
work
 
as
 
"stereo
 
-20%"
 
(for
 
example).”
 “Q:  wouldn’t  this  mean  that  there  will  be  more  backing  vocal  bleed  in  the  lead  vocal  stem  
too?
 A:  The  model  behaves  differently.  In  some  cases,  it  completely  isolates  vocals,  in  other  
cases
 
it
 
gets
 
confused
 
and
 
vocals
 
appear
 
in
 
both
 
stems
 
at
 
once,
 
in
 
other
 
cases
 
it
 
doesn't
 
isolate
 
at
 
all.”
  Q:  What  are  the  differences  between  mel-roformer  karaoke  and  the  last  model?  A:  “If  the  vocals  don't  contain  harmonies,  this  model  (Mel)  is  better.  In  other  cases,  it  is  better  
to
 
use
 
the
 
MDX+UVR
 
Chain
 
ensemble
 
for
 
now.”
