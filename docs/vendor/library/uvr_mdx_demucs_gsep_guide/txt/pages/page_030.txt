    You  just  gotta  put  all  the  tracks  you  want  to  test  on  in  the  **"tracks"**  folder  then  double-click  
on
 
**"inference.bat"**
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
inference
 
script
 it's  like  if  you  were  to  type  in  the  command  in  cmd,  but  it's  simpler,  and  I'm  lazy"  -  mesk   -  Shared  bias  added  during  weight  conversion  was  removed  from  the  SW  model,  making  it

code
 
(it
 
was
 
just
 
a
 
leftover
 
not
 
doing
 
anything,
 
just
 
zeroes).
 
Also,
 
delete
 
the
 
shared
 
bias
 
line
 
from
 
the
 
yaml.
  Also,  it  was  possible  to  trim  the  model  size  to  have  only  vocals  (although  it  probably  can  be  
achievable
 
quicker
 
in
 
the
 
config).
 
mask_estimators.0
 
is

for
 
vocals
 
(each
 
mask
 
estimator
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
other
 
stem).

  -  Aufr33’s  Mel-Roformer  Denoise  average  variant  (link |  yaml |  Colab)  can  be  also  used  for  crowd  removal  (Gabox)   -  (MVSEP)  “I  released  new  MVSep  Violin  (violin,  other).  It  based  on  BS  Roformer  model  with

so
 
cool.”

 “Very  neat  model.  (...)  Sometimes  the  model  does  seem  to  pick  up  more  than  just  violins  
imo,
 
but
 
yeah
 
for
 
separating
 
high
 
strings
 
in
 
particular
 
it
 
is
 
really
 
cool.”
