    Now  it’s  only  applicable  for  Ensemble  and  Manual  Ensemble  in  Audio  Tools.  
Manual
 
Ensemble
 
is
 
very
 
fast,
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
on
 
even
 
old
 
dual-core
 
CPU,
 
as
 
it
 
uses
 
already
 
separated
 
files
 
and
 
simple
 
code
 
-
 
not
 
model.

Ensemble
 
-
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
use
 
multiple
 
models
 
to
 
potentially
 
get
 
better
 
results.
  Rules  to  be  broken  here,  but:  Max  Spec  is  generally  for  vocals   
(is
 
maximum
 
result
 
of
 
each
 
stem,
 
e.g.
 
in
 
a
 
vocal
 
you'll
 
get
 
the
 
heaviest
 
weighted
 
vocal
 
from
 
each
 
model,
 
and
 
the
 
same
 
goes
 
for
 
instrumental,
 
giving
 
a
 
bit
 
cleaner
 
results,
 
but
 
more
 
artefacts)
 Min  Spec  for  instrumentals  in  most  cases   
(it
 
leaves
 
the
 
similarity
 
from
 
the
 
models)
 Avg  Spec  is  something  in  between   
(gets
 
the
 
average
 
of
 
vocals/instrumentals)
  E.g.  following  the  above,  we  get  the  following  setting:  “Max  Spec  /  Min  Spec”  Left  side  =  about  the  Vocal  stem/output  Right  side   =  about  the  Instrumental  stem/output  "Max  takes  the  highest  values  between  each  separation  to  create  the  new  one  (fuller  
sounding,
 
more
 
bleed).
 Min  takes  the  lowest  values  between  each  separation  to  create  the  new  one  (filtered  
sounding,
 
less
 
bleed).
 Avg  is  the  average  of  each  separation."  
 More   For  ensemble,  avg/avg  got  the  highest  SDR,  then  worse  results  for  respectively  max/max,  
min/max
 
and
 
min/min.
  For  single  MDX  model,  min  spec  was  the  safest  for  instrumental  models  and  gave  the  most  
consistent
 
results
 
with
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
others.
 Max  spec  -  is  the  cleanest  -  but  can  leave  some  artifacts  (if  you  don't  have  them  in  your  file,  
then
 
Max
 
Spec
 
for
 
your
 
instrumental
 
like
 
now
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
solution).
 Avg  -  the  best  of  the  both  worlds  and  the  only  possible  to  test  SDR  e.g.  at  least  for  
ensembles,
 
maybe
 
even
 
to
 
this
 
day
 
if
 
it
 
wasn't
 
patched
  “Max  Spec/Min  Spec”  option  For  at  least  a  single  instrumental  model,  it's  the  safest  approach  for  instrumentals  and  
universal
 
for
 
vocals.
 
E.g.
 
Min
 
Mag/Spec
 
in
 
kae
 
Colab
 
using
 
the
 
old
 
codebase
 
for
 
MDX
 
models
 
gives
 
me
 
the
 
only
 
acceptable
 
results
 
with
 
hip-hop.
