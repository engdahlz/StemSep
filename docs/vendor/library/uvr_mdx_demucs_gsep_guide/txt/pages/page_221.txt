     Keeping  only  backing  vocals  in  a  song  (lead  vocal  extractor):   >Karaoke   You  might  want  to  use  a  good  vocal model  as  a  preprocessor  to  use  with  the  models  below  (if  MVSEP/x-minus  don’t  do  it  already),  but  sometimes  it  can  degrade  the  quality,  so  experiment  both  
ways.
 
 Optionally  you  may  also  de-reverb vocals  with  a  good  model/plugin  first  before  proceeding,  but  only  if  the  specific  model/method  doesn’t  filter  out  a  lot  of  BGVs  in  your  vocals.   -  Anvuew’s  Karaoke  BS-Roformer  model |  metrics |  incompatible  with  UVR  RTX  5000  patch  |  MSST |  MVSEP  |  Colab (Lead  vocals/backing  with  instrumental)  “extracts  lead  vocals  a  bit  better  than  karaoke  becruily  frazer,  and  in  some  parts,  the  lead

 “lead  vocals  leak  into  instrumental  (...)  Mel  Becruily  and  Frazer’s  BS  don’t  have  this  problem”  In  that  case,  maybe  “isolate  the  acapella  first  in  almost  all  cases  of  using  a  karaoke  model”  
or
 
use
 
the
 
model
 
below
 
instead.

 “It  also  can  detect  the  double  vocals”  -  black_as_night  It  works  the  best  for  some  previously  difficult  songs.  Aufr33  and  viperx  model  seems  more

the

is

 “It  does  do  better  on  mono  than  previous,  sometimes  confuses  which  voice  should  be  the
