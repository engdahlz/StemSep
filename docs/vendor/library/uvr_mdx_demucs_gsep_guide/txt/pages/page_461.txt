    It’s  much  more  hassle  to  use  it  than  drumsep,  but  it’s  very  good  “if  you  need  particular  sound  
and
 
not
 
about
 
pattern
 
etc.
 1.  separate  drums  from  whole  track  (demucs)  2.  Cut  drum  track  into  max  30  second  cuts  [regroover  limits]  and  ideally    cut  right  on  
transient,
 
some
 
space
 
before
 
kick
 
helps,
 2.  You  use  regroover  for  the  first  time  and  for  example  try  to  separate  to  4  tracks,  just  so  
overall
 
separation.
 3.  Those  separation  sums  exactly  to  that  is  given,  sometimes  it  just  need  to  be  realigned  few  
ms.
 4.  And  if  for  example  kick  still  has  some  not  needed  parts,  you  just  regroove  it  once  again.   If  are  looking  overall  fast  and  for  patterns,  drumsep.  Regroover  for  painfull  but  precise  job.  
Also
 
in
 
most
 
cases
 
hihats
 
are
 
trash,
 
but
 
snare's
 
and
 
kicks
 
you
 
often
 
can
 
find
 
perfetclu
 
usable
 
ones.
 
I'm
 
not
 
sure
 
about
 
metal
 
but
 
overall.”
 
UnMixingStation   "Very,  very  old  and  almost  impossible  to  find,  but  the  separations  are  95%  close  to  Regroover".  The  software  is  13  years  old,  and  their  site  is  down,  and  the  tool  doesn’t  seem  
to
 
be
 
available
 
to
 
buy
 
anywhere.
  
LarsNet   Adden  on  MVSep.  Colab.  Source:  https://github.com/polimi-ispl/larsnet  It  separates  previously  separated  drums  into  5  stems:  kick,  snare,  cymbals,  toms,  hihat.    It’s  worse  than  Drumsep  as  it  uses  Spleeter-like  architecture,  but  “at  least  they  have  an  extra  
output,
 
so
 
they
 
separate
 
hihats
 
and
 
cymbals.”.
 
Colab
 “Baseline  models  don't  seem  better  quality  than  drumsep,  but  the  provided  checkpoints  are  
trained
 
with
 
oly
 
22
 
epochs,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
much.
 
(and
 
STEMGMD
 
dataset
 
was
 
limited
 
by
 
the
 
only
 
10
 
drumkits),
 
so
 
it
 
could
 
probably
 
be
 
better
 
with
 
better
 
dataset
 
&
 
training”
 Similar  situation  as  with  Drumsep  -  you  should  provide  drums  separated  from  e.g.  Demucs  
model.
    There’s  also  Zynaptiq  Unmix  Drums,  but  it’s  not  exactly  a  separation  tool,  but  to  “Boost  Or  
Attenuate
 
Drums
 
In
 
Mixed
 
Music”.
