I
 
will
 
try
 
to
 
solve
 
this
 
issue,
 
and
 
probably
 
move
 
to
 
another
 
country
 
such
 
as
 
Kazakhstan
 
or
 
Uzbekistan,

it
 
will
 
take
 
some
 
time,
 
and
 
servers
 
must
 
be
 
paid
 
for
 
monthly.
  As  a  temporary  solution,  I  will  use  Boosty.  I  ask  everyone  who  is  subscribed  to  Patreon  to  cancel  your  subscription  and  subscribe  to  Boosty:  https://boosty.to/uvr  **Just  a  reminder  that  I'm  switching  from  Patreon  to  Boosty.**    If  you  want  to  renew  your  subscription  but  don't  want  to  mess  with  Boosty,  I've  found  an  
alternative

Update  31.10.22  The  release  of  the  new  instrumental  models  for  patreons  -   optimised  for  better  hi-end  (lower  FFT  parameter),  not  so  big  cutoff  during  training  and  
possibly
 
better
 
results
 
for
 
hip-hop
 
(and
 
possibly
 
more
 
genres).

In  some  cases  it  does  a  really  good  job,  but  on  others  it's  worse  than  418.”
