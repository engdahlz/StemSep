  -  Using  this  repo,  you  can  convert  Mel-Roformers,  HTDemucs  and  Apollo  models  to  OpenVINO  (so  to  onnx)   -  Lew,  if  you  read  it,  some  guy  wants  to  add  your  Apollo  uni  model  into  a  plugin  for  
OpenVINO
 
and
 
Intel’s
 
HF,
 
but
 
the
 
model
 
lacks
 
an

licence.
 
If
 
you
 
could
 re-release  it  with  the  proper  licence,  it  would  be  appreciated.  More  -  (x-minus/uvronline)  “I  added  two  new  models  to  remove  vocals  and  hid  a  few  old  ones.   So  there  are  now  only  three  main  models  in  the  menu  for  different  purposes:   Mel-RoFormer  by  Gabox  Fv7z  -  best  bleedless,  good  fullness,  almost  noiseless  Mel-RoFormer  by  unwa  v1e+  -  best  fullness,  average  bleedless  Mel-RoFormer  unwa  big  beta6x  -  best  vocals   Older  models  are  still  available  at  the  link:
