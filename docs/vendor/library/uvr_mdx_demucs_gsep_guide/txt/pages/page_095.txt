    -  RTX  5000  series  support  on  Windows  was  added  in  a  separate  UVR  patch (or  you  can  use  OpenCL  (DirectML)  in  options  instead  [slower]).  The  patch  is  not  compatible  with  Intel/AMD  
GPUs,
 
and
 
potentially
 
also
 
older
 
NVIDIA
 
GPUs,
 
giving
 
the
 
following
 
error:
 AttributeError:  module  'torch_directml'  has  no  attribute  'is_available’   In  patch  #12  a  new  “Inference  mode”  option  in  Advanced  MDX-Net>Multi  Network  was  
implemented
 
(disabled
 
by
 
default).
 
In
 
the
 
current
 
state,
 
it
 
fixes
 
silence
 
in
 
separation
 
on
 
GTX
 
10XX
 
and
 
maybe
 
older,
 
but
 
might
 
make
 
separations
 
longer
 
for
 
other
 
compatible
 
GPUs.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
slower
 
separations
 
after
 
updating
 
UVR,
 
check
 
if
 
GPU
 
Conversion
 
is
 
still
 
enabled
 
(it’s
 
rather
 
disabled
 
by
 
default
 
on
 
new
 
installations)
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
try
 
to
 
turn
 
on
 
Inference
 
Mode
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
RTX
 
GPU,
 
or
 
potentially
 
GTX
 
16XX.

  -  for  Linux    Sadly,  the  currently  released  branch  working  on  Linux  is  old  and  doesn’t  support  all  models  
(at
 
least
 
without
 
some
 
workarounds
 
below)
 
and
 
you
 
can’t
 
use
 
WINE
 
and
 
keep
 
GPU
 
acceleration.
 Some  installation  directions (from  our  Discord)  from  Roformer  patch  #1/2  period  (or  also  here),  plus  comment  out  segmentation-models-pytorch  0.3.3  in  requirements.txt  here (line  136)  (for  Nvidia/CPU).  
Current
 
code
 
repository
 
for
 
Roformers
 
with
 
DirectML
 
support
 
is
 
located
 
here
 
(although
 
at
 
certain
 
periods
 
it
 
might
 
lack
 
current
 
patches):
 
(might
 
work
 
for
 
non-Nvidia
 
GPUs):
 https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/tree/v5.6.0_roformer_add%2Bdirectml Judging  by  the  date  of  files  from  9  December  2024  in  the  repo  at  the  moment,  they  seem  to  
derive
 
from
 
outdated
 
12_8_24_23_30_BETA
 
beta
 
#9
 
patch
 
(some
 
newer
 
models
 
will
 
fail
 
with
 
that
 
codebase,
 
plus
 
it’s
 
before
 
chunk_size
 
implementation,
 
so
 
it
 
rather
 
still
 
uses
 
dim_t).

useful
 
information:
