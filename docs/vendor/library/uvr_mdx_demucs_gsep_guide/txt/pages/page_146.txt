    It's  there  in  MDX23C  because  now  the  new  arch  supports  multiple  stems  separation  in  one  
model
 
file.
  -  Disabling  "match  freq  cutoff"  in  advanced  MDX  settings  seems  to  fix  issues  with  10kHz  
cutoff
 
in
 
vocals
 
of
 
HQ3
 
model.
  -  New  explanations  on  Demucs  parameters  added  in  Demucs  4  section  (shifts  0,  overlap  0.99  won in  SDR  vs shifts  1,  overlap  0.99  and  even shifts  10,  overlap  0.95)   -  "Last  update  of  Neutone  VST  plugin  has  now  a  Demucs  model  to  use  in  realtime  in  a  DAW  (it's  a  'light'  version  of  Demucs_mmi)  https://neutone.space/models/1a36cd599cd0c44ec7ccb63e77fe8efc/ It  doesn't  use  GPU,  and  it's  configured  to  be  fast  with  very  low  parameters,  also  the  model  is  
not
 
the
 
best
 
on
 
its
 
own.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
give
 
decent
 
results,
 
so
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
stick
 
to
 
other
 
realtime
 
alternatives
 
(see
 
document
 
outline)
  -  Turns  out  that  with  a  GPU  with  lots  of  VRAM  e.g.  24GB,  you  can  run  two  instances  of  UVR,  
so
 
the
 
processing
 
will
 
be
 
faster.
 
You
 
only
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
4096
 
segmentation
 
instead
 
of
 
8192.
  SDR  difference  between  overlap  0.95  and  0.99  for  voc_ft  MDX  model  in  (new/beta)  UVR  is  
0.02.
  0.8  seems  to  be  the  best  point  for  ensembles   12K  segmentation  performed  worse  than  4K  SDR-wise   -  Recommended  balanced  values  between  quality  and  time  for  6GB  graphic  cards  in  the  
latest
 
beta:
  VR  Architecture:  Window  Size:  320   MDX-Net:   Segment  Size:  2752  (1024  if  it’s  taking  too  long)  Overlap:  0.7-/0.8   Demucs:   Segment:  Default  Shifts:  2  (def)  Overlap:  0.5   (exp.  0.75,   def.  0.25)
