    instrumentals  can  be  inverted  to  get  just  vocals  despite  the  fact  they  claim  to  use  some  
recovery
 
technology.
  -  arigato78  method for  main  vocals   -Captain  Curvy  method  for  instrumentals  added  in  instrumentals  models  list  section  (the  top  
link)
  -  For  canceling  room  reverb  check  out:  Reverb  HQ  then  De-echo  model  (J2)   -  Sometimes  vox_ft  can  pick  up  SFX   -  Install  UVR5  GUI  only  in  the  default  location  picked  by  the  installer.  Otherwise,  you  might  
get
 
python39.dll
 
error
 
on
 
startup.
 
If
 
you
 
see
 
that
 
error
 
after
 
installing
 
the
 
beta
 
patch,
 
reinstall
 
the
 
whole
 
app.
  -  Few  of  our  users  finally  evaluated  sonically  new  dango.ai  9.0  models.  Turns  out  the  models  
are
 
not
 
UVR's
 
(or
 
no
 
longer),
 
and
 
actually
 
give
 
pretty
 
close
 
results
 
to
 
original
 
instrumentals,
 
but
 
not
 
so
 
good
 
vocals.
 
 "It's  slightly  better  but  still  voc_ft  keeps  more  reverb/delays  but  again,  it's  99%  close,  Dango  has  maybe  more  noise  reduction"  maybe  even  less  
instrumental
 
residues
 
(can
 
be
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
noise
 
reduction).
 "A  bit  cleaner  than  voc_ft  in  terms  of  having  synths/instruments,  but  they  do  sound  a  bit  
filtered
 
at
 
times.
 
[In]
 
overall
 
it's
 
close
 
tho"
 "I  discovered  Dango's  conservative  mode  keeps  instrumentals  even  fuller,  but  might  
introduce
 
some
 
background
 
vocals
 still  quite  better  than  what  we  have.  I'm  still  surprised  how  it's  so  clean,  as  if  not  having  vocal  residues  like  any  other  MDX  model.  
Sometimes
 
the
 
Dango
 
sounds
 
like
 
a
 
blend
 
of
 
VR's
 
architecture,
 
but
 
I'm
 
probably
 
wrong,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
the
 
recovery
 
technology"
