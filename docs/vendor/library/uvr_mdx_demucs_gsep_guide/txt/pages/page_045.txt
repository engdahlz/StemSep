    XL  “result  would  take  so  much  longer,  but  the  large  results  sounded  better  imo”  5B   “The  Colab  is  forcing  a  different  value  than  the  one  from  the  config.  You  can  try  to  edit  the

 The  Colab  only  changes  chunk_size  (value  from  GUI),  batch_size  (forcing  =1)  and  overlap  
(value

it

 Large  model  uses  7GB  VRAM  on  Nvidia  GPU  in  UVR  with  default  config  settings.   -  Sir  Joseph  released  SESA  Fast  Separation Colab  based  on  UVR.  It’s  faster  than  the  regular  SESA Colab  (whiuch  now  has  “added  Apollo  to  Auto  Ensemble  and  fixed  a  few  technical  glitches.  It’s  running  smoother  now!”)  
More
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
fast
 
Colab:
 V1e+  and  Gabox  inst  fv8  are  missing  because  the  model  list  cannot  be  updated  in  the  Fast  
Colab
 
yet.
 
“auto-ensemble
 
feature
 
is
 
included
 
here
 
too.
 Background  noise  suppression  is  a  bit  more  polished.  You  can  specify  unwanted  stems  to  filter  out.”   -  (x-minus/uvronline)  “1.  A  new  Mel-RoFormer  by  unwa  v1e+  model  has  been  added.  It  
removes
 
vocals
 
very
 
gently
 
while
 
preserving
 
instruments.
 
It
 
is
 
recommended
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
with
 
correct_phase
 
post-processing.
 2.  Mel-RoFormer  by  Kim  &  unwa  ft3  and  some  other  models  are  hidden.  As  before,  you  can  find  them  here:  https://uvronline.app/ai?hp&test”  -  Aufr33   “The  only  problem  is  the  phase  correction,  it  still  uses  FT2  as  a  reference  [for  phase  fixer],  
and
 
FT2
 
cuts
 
instruments
 
still,
 
so
 
I'm
 
waiting
 
for
 
FT3
 
release
 
by
 
unwa
 
so
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
added
 
as
 
phase
 
fixer

preserve
 
instruments
 
well”

 “Results  are  still  better  with  phase  fixer  though,  right”  Make  sure  you’re  “clicking  on  "Ensemble"?  It  should  "reveal"  that  option”  since  the  last

layout
 
changes.
 “phase  fixer  [on  the  site]  swaps  the  v1e+  vocals  with  the  ft2  vocals”  Iirc  phase  fixer  feature  requires  premium.   -  SESA  Colab  by  Sir  Joseph  is  back!  The  Colab  link  has  changed  -  click Apollo  Integration:  Added  Apollo  audio  enhancement  feature.  Supports  Normal  and  Mid/Side  
methods.
 UI  Updates:  Added  new  Apollo  settings  components  under  the  Settings  tab.  Bug  Fixes:  Fixed  Apollo  output  not  showing  in  the  terminal.  Corrected  "Phase  Remix"  and  "Overlap  Info"  display  in  the  UI.  Translation  Updates:  Added  new  translation  keys  for  Apollo,  removed  unused  keys.
