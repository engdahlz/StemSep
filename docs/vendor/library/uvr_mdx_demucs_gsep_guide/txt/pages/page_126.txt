updated
 
by
 
the
 
time
 
5.57
 
->
 
6.06;
 
added
 
hollywood
 
laughts,
 
old
 
models
 
also
 
available)
  -  VitLarge23  model  on  MVSEP  got  updated  (9.78>9.90  for  instrumentals)   -  MelBand  RoFormer  (9.07  for  vocals)  model  added  on  MVSEP  for  testing  purposes  “The  model  is  really  good  at  removing  the  hi-hat  leftovers.  These  e.g.  in  the  Jarredou  colab  
sometimes
 
when
 
you
 
can
 
hear
 
the
 
hi-hats
 
from
 
the
 
acapella.
 
And
 
Melband
 
roformer
 
can
 
almost
 
remove
 
all
 
the
 
hi-hat
 
leftovers
 
from
 
the
 
acapella.”
 “are  the  stems  not  inverted  result?  for  me  it  sounds  like  there  is  insane  instrument  loss  in  the  
instrumental
 
stem
 
and
 
vocals
 
loss
 
in
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem,
 
yet
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
in
 
instrumental
 
stem
 
and
 
vice
 
versa”
 
“I
 
also
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
vocals
 
are
 
surprisingly
 
clean
 
considering
 
the
 
instrumentals
 
sound
 
quite
 
suppressed
 
but
 
also
 
clean”
  -  Goyo  Beta  plugin  for  dereverb  stopped  working  on  December  2nd  (as  it  required  internet  
connection
 
and
 
silent
 
authorization
 
on
 
every
 
initialization).
 
They
 
transitioned
 
to
 
paid
 
Supertone
 
Clear.
 
They

it,
 
it’s

  -  New  MVSep-MDX23  Colab  Fork  v2.3  by  jarredou  published  under  new  Colab  link  here Now  it  has  Vitlarge23  model  (previously  used  exclusively  on  MVSEP)  instead  of  HQ3-Instr,  
also
 
improved
 
BigShifts
 
and
 
MDXv2
 
processing.
 Doesn't  seem  to  be  better  than  RipX  which  is  better  in  preserving  some  instruments,  and  
also
 
removes
 
vocals
 
completely
  -  Check  out  new  Karaoke recommendations  (dca100fb8)   -  Dango.ai  finally  received  English  web  interface  translation   -  New  SFX  model  based  on  Mel  roformer  was  released  by  jazzpear94.  More  info -  User  friendly  Colab made  by  jarredou  and  forked by  jazzpear94  with  new  feature.  In  case  of  some  problems,  use  WAV  file.   -  Seems  like  Ripple  got  updated,  "it  sounds  a  lot  better  and  less  muddied"  doesn’t  seem  to  
give
 
better
 
results
 
for
 
all
 
songs,
 
though.
 
Might
 
be
 
similar
 
case
 
with
 
Capcut
 
too.
  -  Hit  'n'  Mix  RipX  DAW  Pro  7  released.  For  GPU  acceleration,  min.  requirement  is  8GB  
VRAM
 
and
 
NVIDIA

card
 
or
 
newer
 
(mentioned
 
by
 
the

CPU
 
to
 
2
 
minutes
 
on
 
decent
