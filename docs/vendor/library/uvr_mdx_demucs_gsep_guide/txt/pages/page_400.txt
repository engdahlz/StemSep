    -  In  some  cases,  you  won’t  be  able  to  write  “Y”  in  empty  box  to  continue  on  first  mounting  on  
some
 
Google
 
account.
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
e.g.
 
change
 
browser
 
to
 
Chrome
 
and
 
check
 
PC
 
mode.
  -  In  some  cases,  you  won’t  be  able  to  paste  text  from  clipboard  into  Colab  if  necessary,  when  
being
 
in
 
PC
 
mode
 
on
 
Android,
 
if
 
some
 
opened
 
on-screen
 
applications
 
will
 
prevent
 
the
 
access
 
-
 
you’ll
 
need
 
to
 
close
 
them,
 
or
 
use
 
mobile
 
mode
 
(PC
 
mode
 
unchecked)
  -  (probably  fixed)  If  you  started  having  problems  with  logging  into  Colabs.  >  Actually,  it  doesn't  show  that  you're  logged  in  while  the  button  says  to  log  in.  So,  it  should  respect  redirections  in  Colab  links  to  specific  accounts,  but  if  you're  mounting  to  
GDrive,
 
and
 
it
 
fails
 
with
 
Colab
 
error,
 
simply
 
click
 
the
 
button
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
right
 
corner
 
to
 
log
 
in.
 
It
 
will.
 
Just
 
won't
 
show
 
that
 
you
 
did
 
that.
 
Then
 
Colab
 
will
 
start
 
working.
  -  Don't  use  postprocess  in  ensemble,  or  you'll  encounter  error   -  You  can  try  checking  force  update  in  case  of  errors   -  Go  to  runtime>manage  sessions>terminate  session  and  then  try  again  with  Trigger  force  
update
 
checked
 
(ForceUpdate
 
may
 
not
 
work
 
before
 
terminating
 
session
 
after
 
Colab
 
was
 
launched
 
already).
  -  Make  sure  you  got  4.5GB  free  space  on  GDrive  and  mounting  method  is  set  to  "new".  You  
can
 
try
 
out
 
"old"
 
but
 
it
 
shouldn't
 
work.
 Try  out  a  few  times.   -  If  still  nothing,  delete  VocalRemover5-COLAB_arch  folder  from  GDrive,  and  retry  without  
Trigger
 
update.
 
  On  fresh  installation,  make  sure  you  still  have  4.5GB  space  on  GDrive  (empty  recycle  bin  -  
automatic
 
successful
 
models
 
installation
 
will
 
leave
 
separate
 
files
 
there
 
as
 
well,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
space
 
on
 
cluttered
 
GDrive
 
easily)
  -  If  still  nothing  (e.g.  when  models  can’t  be  found  on  separation  attempt),  then  download  that  
thing,
 
and
 
extract
 
that
 
folder
 
to
 
the
 
root
 
(main)
 
directory
 
of
 
Gdrive,
 
so
 
it
 
looks
 
like
 
following:
 
Gdrive\VocalRemover5-COLAB_arch
 
and
 
files
 
are
 
inside,
 
like
 
in
 
the
 
following
 
link:
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnjwPlX1uc9yrqE-L64ofJ5EP_a8X407?usp=sharing and  then  try  again  running  the  Colab:  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16Q44VBJiIrXOgTINztVDVeb0XKhLKHwl  -  if  you  cannot  connect  with  GPU  anymore  and/or  you  exceeded  your  GPU  limit  try  to  log  into  another  Google  account.   -  Try  not  to  exceed  1  hour  when  processing  one  file  or  one  batch  of  files,  otherwise  you'll  get  
disconnected.
