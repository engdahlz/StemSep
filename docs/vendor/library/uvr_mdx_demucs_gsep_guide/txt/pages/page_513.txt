     "Ripple  seems  to  be  SpongeBand  just  translated  into  English,  it  was  released  last  year:  https://pandaily.com/bytedance-launches-music-creation-tool-sponge-band/ (more  info  about  its  capabilities)  Back  then,  it  only  didn't  have  separation  to  4  stems  (but  now  the  separation  feature  is  
defunct,
 
anyway).
  _______   For  enhancing  vocal  track  you  can  use  WSRGLOW,  and  better  yet,  process  it  through  
Izotope
 
RX
 
(7-9)
 
spectral
 
recovery
 
tool
 
(in
 
RX
 
10
 
it’s
 
only
 
in
 
more
 
expensive
 
version
 
irc),
 
and
 
then
 
master
 
it,
 
or
 
send
 
it
 
somewhere
 
else
 
above.
 https://replicate.com/lucataco/wsrglow  There  are  a  lot  of  requests  for  music  upscaling  on  our  Discord.  You  can  use  online  mastering  
services
 
as
 
well.
 
Technically
 
it's
 
not
 
upscaling
 
in
 
most
 
cases,
 
but
 
the
 
result
 
can
 
be
 
satisfactory
 
at
 
times.
 If  you  try  out  all  solutions,  and  learn  how  they  work  and  sound,  you  can  easily  get  any  track  
in
 
better
 
quality
 
in
 
few
 
minutes.
  For  very  low  resolution  music  (if  you  manage  to  run  it):   AudioSR  -  used  more  often  then  the  below,  lately  (voc/inst)   Audio  Super  Resolution  https://github.com/olvrhhn/audio_super_resolution  hifi-gan-bwe  https://github.com/brentspell/hifi-gan-bwe/   More  details  and  links,  Colabs  for  these  in  the  upscaler’s  full  list   If  you  want  to  start  making  your  own  remasters  (even  if  your  file  is  in  terrible  quality,  
especially
 
22kHz):
 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GLWvwNG5Ity2OpTe_HARHQxgwYuoosseYcxpzVjL_wY/edit?usp=drivesdk Might  be  useful  also  for  low  quality,  crusty  vocals,  but  it  is  also  a  guide  for  mixing  music  in  
overall
 
but
 
focused
 
on
 
audio
 
restoration
 
as
 
well.
