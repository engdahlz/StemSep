   Refactored  best  weighted  ensemble  finder  by  jarredou  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rm09z1wpj0Pi-6bFQ15u767n1XV95pDz/view?usp=sharing  “That's  what  I've  used  to  find  optimal  weights  for  my  MDX23  fork  v2.5  update.  It's  still  Nelder-Mead  based  optimizer,  but  code  is  way  more  simple/clean  than  1st  version.   To  use  it,  you  need:  A  dataset  of  clean  sources  (with  exact  same  filename  scheme  than  mvsep  multisong  
dataset).
 Process  dataset  mixtures  with  all  the  models  you  want  to  ensemble  and  put  the  outputs  in  
different
 
folders,
 
1
 
for
 
each
 
model
 
(and
 
still
 
with
 
exact
 
same
 
filename
 
scheme
 
than
 
mvsep
 
multisong
 
dataset).
 librosa  and  scipy  python  libs  then  run  (for  example):  weight_finder_v2.py  \    --ref  c:\reference_dataset  \    --est  c:\InstVoc  c:\bsrofo1296  c:\kimrofo  \    --stem  vocals  \    --extension  flac  \    --tracks  100   --ref  is  clean  sources'  folder  path  --est  is  estimates  (separations)  folder  paths  (multiple  inputs)  --stem  is  stem  name  (based  on  multisong  dataset  filename  scheme)  --extension  is  audio  file  extension  (flac/wav...)  --tracks  is  a  number  of  tracks  in  a  dataset.    It  will  process  the  datasets  many  times  and  change  weights  each  time  until  it  find  the  best  
balance.
 
When
 
finished,
 
it
 
will
 
output
 
weights
 
scaled
 
to
 
10
 
max
 
value.
 Warning:  it  can  take  hours  (or  even  days,  depending  on  the  number  of  models  to  ensemble,  
size
 
of
 
dataset
 
and
 
resources
 
of
 
computer)
