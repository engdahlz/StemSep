     Bas  Curtiz  tutorial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ7a3W8qy5o __   General  bots  usage  instructions   Go  to  proper  dl  request  channel  and  write  !dl  and  after  !dl  (on  Discord  $dl),  paste  a  link  to  your  album  or  song  from  the  desired  streaming  
service
 
and
 
send
 
the
 
message,
 
e.g.
 !dl  https://www.deezer.com/en/track/XXXXXX  Follow  this  link  pattern.  Sometimes  the  sharing  option  on  the  site  changes  the  link  pattern,  
so
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
open
 
the
 
changed
 
link,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
will
 
redirect
 
to
 
the
 
one
 
similarly
 
looking
 
like
 
above.
  To  open  the  Deezer  player  to  search  for  files  without  active  subscription,  log-in  and  just  go  
to:
 https://www.deezer.com/search/rjd2%20deadringer And  replace  the  search  query  with  yours  after  opening  the  link.   If  the  bot  doesn’t  respond  in  an  instant,  it  probably  means  the  track/album  is  
regional-blocked,
 
and
 
you
 
should
 
use
 
a
 
link
 
from
 
another
 
service
 
or
 
another
 
channel
 
(UK
 
and
 
NZ
 
alternative
 
servers
 
available).
 
It's
 
capable
 
of
 
printing
 
out
 
unavailability
 
errors
 
as
 
well.
  Some  bots  rip  tracks  or  whole  albums  from  Qobuz,  Deezer,  Tidal  -  all  losslessly,  while:  Spotify,  Soundcloud  Go+,  YouTube  Music,  JioSaavn  are  lossy.     Providing  valid  links  for  bot   For  your  comfort,  you  should  register  and  log  into  every  streaming  service  and  share  links  
for
 
specific
 
tracks
 
or
 
albums
 
from
 
these
 
services
 
(e.g.
 
instead
 
of
 
pasting
 
full
 
album
 
links
 
if
 
you
 
want),
 
when
 
you
 
can’t
 
simply
 
find
 
a
 
specific
 
single
 
track
 
in
 
Google
 
for
 
this
 
service,
 
or
 share  the  link  only  for  it  comfortably.  So  basically  go  to  https://play.qobuz.com/,  and  you  can  share  single  tracks  to  paste  for  bot  to  download  -  available  only  after  logging  
into
 
free
 
account
 
and
 
only
 
in
 
the
 
link
 
above
 
instead
 
of
 
regular
 
Qobuz
 
file
 
search
 
you
 
can
 
find
 
in
 
Google
 
-
 
there
 
you
 
cannot
 
share
 
single
 
songs
 
to
 
download
 
using
 
bot
 
later.
 
It
 
can
 
happen
 
that
 
you’ll
 
see
 
an
 
error
 
that
 
Qobuz
 
is
 
not
 
available
 
in
 
your
 
country.
 
It’s
 
fine
 
-
 
you
 
won’t
 
have
 
to
 
buy
 
a
 
subscription
 
at
 
this
 
step
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
use
 
their
 
search.
 
It’s
 
enough
 
to
 
log-in
 
using
 
specific
 
link
 
and
 
not
 
the
 
main
 
page,
 
use
 
this
 
one:
 https://play.qobuz.com/search/tracks And  it  will  allow  you  to  log  in.
