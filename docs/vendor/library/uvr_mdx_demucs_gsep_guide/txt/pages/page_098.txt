 -  “For  Roformer  models,  it  must  detect  a  stem  called  "Instrumental”  so  for  some  models  like  
Mel-Kim,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
open
 
model’s
 
corresponding
 
yaml,
 
and
 
change
 
“other”
 
to
 
“instrumental”.”
 “With  the  new  config  editor  feature  you  could  probably  edit  the  configs  of  models  to  have  the  
vocal
 
stem
 
labelled
 
as
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
stem
 
so
 
the
 
demudder
 
demuds
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem,
 
it
 
definitely
 
still
 
makes
 
a
 
difference
 
 I  accidentally  did  this  when  installing  another  model,  but  it  seems  to  actually  have  an  effect  
on
 
vocal
 
stems
 
too”
