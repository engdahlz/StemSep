     -  arigato78  method  “Karaoke  2  really  won't  pick  up  any  chorus  lead  vocals  EXCEPT  for  ad-libs  6-HP  will  pick  up  the  melody,  although  it's  usually  muffled  as  hell”  “Q:  is  mdx  karaoke  2  still  the  best  for  lead  and  back  vocals'  separation?  A:  I'm  finding  it's  the  best  for  "fullness"  but  6-HP  picks  up  chorus  melody  while  K2  only  
usually
 
picks
 
up
 
ad-libs
 I  personally  like  mixing  K2,  6-HP  (and  sometimes  5-HP  if  6-HP  sounds  very  thin)  together  also,  let's  say  a  verse  has  back  vocals  that  are  just  the  melody  behind  the  lead  vocal  
(instead
 
of
 
harmonies)
 
for
 
a
 
doubling
 
effect,
 
sometimes
 
K2
 
will
 
still
 
pick
 
up
 
both
 
the
 
lead
 
and
 
double.”
