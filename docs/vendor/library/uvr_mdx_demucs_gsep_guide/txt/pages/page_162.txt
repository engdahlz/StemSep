    BS  2025.07/BS  2024.04/BS  2024.08/SW  removes  less  noise  than  viperx  models  for  phase

very
 
little

But
 
it
 
can’t
 
remove
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
just
 
vocal
 
noise.
 Might  also  sound  interesting  when  using  as  target  in  Phase  fixer,  and  with  source  set  as  
Becruily
 
inst
 
model
 
(overlap
 
50/chunk_size

was
 
used;
 
very
 
slow

 Or  bigbeta5e  as  a  source  to  get  rid  of  vocal  residues  -  santilli_  (single  model  inference  descriptions  below)  “strange  leakage  [robot-like]  in  the  vocal-only  section  with  no  instrumentation”  -  Unwa  ”less  noise  than  v1e  (probably  due  to  different  loss  function),  but  it’s  also  less  full,  
“somewhere
 
between
 
v1e
 
and
 
v1”
 “sometimes  a  detail  piece  of  instrumental  sound  was  lost,  while  on  becruily  inst  [below]  can  
pick
 
that
 
sound”.
 
Might
 
be
 
too
 
strong
 
for
 
MIDI
 
sounds

”has

it’s
 
like

(more
 
fullness).
  -  Gabox  inst_fv4 (yaml)  |  Colab Inst.  fullness  39.40,  bleedless  33.49,  SDR  16.44  Don’t  confuse  it  with  inst_fv4noise  -  the  regular  variant  was  never  released  before  (and  with

 “Seems  to  be  erasing  a  xylophone  instrument.  Does  sound  not  too  noisy  and  not  muddy,  I  
like
 
it.
 
(...)
 
A
 
little
 
noisy
 
with
 
piano
 
(I
 
split
 
the
 
song
 
up
 
and
 
process
 
with
 
resurrection
 
inst
 
there).
 
(...)
 
Does
 
have
 
some
 
issues
 
that
 
resurrection
 
inst
 
doesn't
 
have,
 
but
 
it
 
doesn't
 
sound
 
muddy!
 
It
 
usually
 
works
 
great.
 
(...)
 
In
 
my
 
opinion,
 
fv4
 
still
 
has
 
vocal
 
traces,
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
in
 
all
 
of
 
its
 
songs
 
and
 
v1e
 
plus
 
doesn't
 
have
 
them,
 
but
 
the
 
noise
 
can
 
bother
 
you
 
even
 
though
 
it's
 
not
 
much.
 
Does
 
have
 
more
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
at
 
times.
 
I
 
think
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
what
 
I
 
thought
 
was
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
was
 
a
 
synth,
 
it
 
did
 
a
 
pretty
 
good
 
job...
 
There
 
was
 
one
 
segment
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
where
 
it
 
caught
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
though”
