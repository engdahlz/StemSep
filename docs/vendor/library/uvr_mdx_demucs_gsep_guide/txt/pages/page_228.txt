   Or  Mateus  Contini's method.   How  to  extract  backing  vocals  X-Minus  Guide (can  be  executed  in  UVR5  as  well)   Vinctekan  Q&A  Q:  Which  BVE  aggression  settings  (for  VR  model,  e.g.  uvr-bve-4b-sn-44100-1)  is  good  for  
backing
 
removal?
 A:  “I  recommend  starting  from  exactly  from  0  and  working  from  there  to  either  -  or  +.  0  is  the  baseline  for  BVE  that  are  almost  perfectly  center.  If  it's  off  to  the  left  or  right  a  little  bit,  I  would  start  from  50”  Q:  How  do  I  tell  what  side  BVs  are  panned  or  if  they  are  Stereo  50  %  or  80  %  without  
extracting
 
them?
 A:   “It's  more  about  listening  to  the  track.  The  way  I  used  to  it  is  to  invert  the  left  channel  with  
the
 
right
 
channel.
 
In
 
most
 
cases
 
this
 
should
 
only
 
leave
 
the
 
reverb
 
of
 
the
 
vocals
 
in
 
place,
 
but
 
if
 
there
 
is
 
backing
 
vocals
 
that
 
is
 
panned
 
either
 
left
 
or
 
right,
 
then
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
louder
 
than
 
the
 
reverb.
 
Audacity's
 
[Vocal
 
Reduction
 
and
 
Isolation>Analyze]
 
feature
 
usually
 
can
 
give
 
a
 
rough
 
estimates
 
as
 
to
 
how
 
related
 
the
 
two
 
channels
 
are,
 
but
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
tell
 
where
 
the
 
backing
 
vocal
 
actually
 
is.
 
I
 
would
 
only
 
recommend
 
doing
 
the
 
above
 
with
 
a
 
vocal
 
output,
 
though.”
 Q:  Does  anyone  know  how  to  tell  what  side  BV's  (backing  Vocals)  are  panned  similar  to  this?  Like,  is  there  a  way  to  tell  using  RipX?  Or  another  tool.  In  my  case  I  think  mine  might  be  
Stereo

30
 
percent
 
or
 
lower
