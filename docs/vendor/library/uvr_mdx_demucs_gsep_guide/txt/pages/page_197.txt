a

better

(fullness:
 
21.33,
 
bleedless:

SDR

 vs  voc_fv4  "It  is  noisier...  Kinda  closer  to  beta  5e?”  “It's  slightly  less  noise  and  fullness  than  
beta
 
5e
 
but
 
picking
 
up
 
the
 
backing

REALLY
 
well,
 
significantly
 
better
 
than
 
beta
 
5e”
 But  it's  pulling  the  backing  vocals  out  even  better  than  5e”  “the  backing  vocals  are  so  good!  “it  does  have  significant  synth  bleed,  too...    it  at  least  wasn't  coming  through  at  full  volume  when  I  say  fullness,  I  specifically  mean  how  muddy  it  sounds”  -  Raiboom  Dash  _  -  Gabox  Mel-Roformer  voc_fv4 |  yaml |  Colab |  Huggingface /  2 *  voc  bleedless  29.07,  fullness  21.33,  SDR  10.58  “Very  clean,  non-muddy  vocals.  Loving  this  model  so  far”  (mrmason347)  Good  for  anime  and  RVC  purposes,  currently  the  best  public  model  for  it  (codename)  “The  important  thing  for  an  RVC  dataset  is  to  get  lead  vocals  so  fv4  is  good  for  that  The  newer  karaoke  models  are  also  helpful”  -  Ryan  Some  might  prefer  voc_gabox2  instead,  occasionally  -  chroniclaugh.  The  opposite  of  Beta6x  which  has  “lower  noise  but  [is]  less  full/muddier  (...)  noise/muddiness  
seems
 
between
 
6x
 
and
 
5e,
 
but
 
even
 
6x
 
is
 
picking
 
up
 
BV
 
just
 
fine,
 
where
 
voc
 
fv4
 
is
 
failing”
 Some  people  might  want  to  test  it  with  even  overlap  32,  and  then:  “It's  close  to  perfect,  the  only  thing  is  it  kinda  struggled  with  picking  up  the  adlibs  and  the  
delay,
 
but
 
the
 
lead
 
vocal
 
is
 
almost
 
perfect
 
I
 
think.
 
(...)
 
on
 
another
 
song
 
(...)
 
5e
 
is
 
just
 
too
 
noisy
 
and
 
6x
 
is
 
muddy,
 
fv4
 
is
 
best
 
of
 
both
 
worlds
 
(...)
 
has
 
segments
 
with
 
constant
 
significant
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
(for
 
the
 
most
 
part,
 
it's
 
not
 
audible
 
at
 
all)
 
(...)
 
I
 
was
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
an
 
acapella
 
and
 
every
 
model
 
failed
 
except
 
this
 
one.
 
It's
 
not
 
perfect,
 
but
 
I
 
guess
 
some
 
songs
 
are
 
just
 
too
 
hard
 
for
 
the
 
AI.”

 Good  also  for  instrumentals,  if  you  need  less  vocal  residues  than  typical  instrumental

 “even  beta  6x  is  a  lot  better  at  pulling  that  background  vocal  out  than  voc  fv4...  and  that's  a  less  full  model.  hmm,  fv6  is  noisier  and  also  not  picking  up  the  backing  vocals  as  
full
 
as
 
the
 
last

You
 
can
 
alleviate
 
some

this

“It's

grainy?
 
When

Definitely
 
not

which
 
is
