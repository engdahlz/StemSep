  Faster,  lower  quality:  -  KUIELab-MDXNET23C (4  stems)  -  its  first  scores  were  probably  from  ensemble  of  its  five  models,  and  in  that  configuration  it  had  better  SDR  than  demucs_ft  on  its  own,  and  drums  
had
 
better
 
SDR
 
than

(so
 
single

score
 
of
 
any

is
 
probably
 
lower
