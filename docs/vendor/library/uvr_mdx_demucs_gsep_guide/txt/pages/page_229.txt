-  Advanced  chain  processing  chart  (image)  It’s  a  method  utilizing  old  models,  and  e.g.  Kim  Vocals  2  can  be  potentially  replaced  by  unwa’s  BS/Mel-Roformer  models  in  beta  UVR (or  other  good  method  for  vocals)  or  ensembles  mentioned  in  this  document.

 htdemucs  v4  above  can  be  replaced  by  htdemucs_ft,  as  it's  the  fine-tuned  version  of  the  model  (or  MDX23  Colab).  Even  better,  you  can  use  some  of  the  methods  for  4  stems in  this  GDoc  (like  drums  on  x-minus).  De-echo  and  reverb  models  can  be  potentially  replaced  by  some  better  paid  plugins  like:  DeVerberate  by  Acon  Digital,  Accentize  DeRoom  Pro  (more  in  the  de-reverb section).  UVR  Denoise  can  be  potentially  replaced  by  less  aggressive  Aufr33  model  on  x-minus.pro  
(used
 
when
 
aggressiveness
 
is
 
set
 
to
 
minimum),
 
and
 
there’s
 
also

Mel-Roformer
