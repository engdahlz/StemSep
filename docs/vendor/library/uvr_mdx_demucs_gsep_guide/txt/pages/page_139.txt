Some  
people
 
can
 
do
 
it
 
after
 
two
 
tries,
 
others

  -  Every  8  seconds  there  is  an  artifact  of  chunking  in  Ripple.  Heal  feature  in  Adobe  Audition  
works
 
really
 
well
 
for
 
it:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqd8Wjqtx-8  -The  same  explained  on  RX  10  example  and  its  Declick  feature:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD3D7f3ungk  -  Ripple/SAMI  Bytedance's  API  was  found.  If  you're  Chinese,  you  can  go  through  it  easier.  The  sami-api-bs-4track  (the  one  with  10.8696  SDR  Vocals)  -  you  need  to  pass  the  
Volcengine
 
facial/document
 
recognition
 
apparently
 
only
 
available
 
to
 
Chinese
 
people
   https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6489/72011  We  already  evaluated  its  SDR,  and  it  even  scored  a  bit  better  than  Ripple  itself.   This  is  the  Ripple  audio  uploading  API:  https://github.com/bitelchux/TikTokUploder/blob/2a0f0241a91b558a7574e6689f39f9dd9c39e295/uploader.py there's  a  sample  script  on  the  volcengine  SAMI  page   "API  from  volcengine  only  return  1  stem  result  from  1  request,  and  it  offers  vocal+inst  only,  
other
 
stems
 
not
 
provided.
 
So
 
making
 
a
 
quality
 
checker
 
result
 
on
 
vocal
 
+
 
instrument
 
will
 
cost
 
2x
 
of
 
its
 
API
 
charging
  something  good  is  that  volcengine  API  offers  100  min  free  for  new  users"   API  is  paid  0.2  CNY  per  minute.
