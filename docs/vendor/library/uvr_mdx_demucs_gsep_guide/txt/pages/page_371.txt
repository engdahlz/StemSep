    -  Music  AI -  better  results  than  those  on  Moises  (same  team).  $25  per  month  or  pay  as  you  go,  pricing  chart,  no  free  trial,  Good  selection  of  models  and  interesting  module  stacking feature.

 “Bass  was  a  fair  bit  better  than  Demucs  HT,  Drums  about  the  same.  Guitars  were  very  good  
though.

the

I'd

a

clearer

out
 
quite
 
well,

 -  Audioshake   -  Myxt -  3  stem  model,  unfortunately,  it  has/had  WAVs  with  16kHz  cutoff  which  Audioshake  normally  doesn't  have.  No  other  stem.  Results,  maybe  slightly  better  than  Demucs.  Might  be  
good
 
for
 
vocals.
