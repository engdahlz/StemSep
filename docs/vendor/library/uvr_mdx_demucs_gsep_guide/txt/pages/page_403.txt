(the  old)  Google  Colab  by  HV  (with  OG  demucs  2  ensembling  for  vocal  models)  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/189nHyAUfHIfTAXbm15Aj1Onlog2qcCp0?usp=sharing Add  separate  cell  as  following,  or  else  it  won’t  work  !pip  install  torch=1.13.1  (probably  numpy  1.25  for  this  old  Torch)   If  you're  still  getting  errors,  delete  whole  MDX_Colab  folder,  terminate  your  session,  make  
clean
 
installation
 
afterward,
 
and
 
don't
 
forget
 
to
 
have
 
this
 
torch
 
line
 
executed
 
after
 
mounting
 
(that
 
might
 
happen
 
in
 
case
 
you
 
manually
 
replaced
 
model.py
 
with
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
ones
 
below,
 
and
 
didn't
 
restore
 
the
 
correct
 
old
 
one).
  (The  Colab  to  use  MDX  easily  in  Google’s  cloud.  Newer  models  not  included,  and  it  gives

you

  (In  case  of  “RuntimeError:  Error  opening  'separated/(trackname)/vocals.wav':  System  error.”  
simply
 
retry)
  More  MDX  models  explained  in  UVR  section  in  the  beginning  of  the  document  since  they're  
a
 
part
 
of
 
UVR
 
GUI
 
now.
 Optionally,  423  model  can  be  downloaded  separately  here (just  in  case,  it’s  main).  It  is  on  MVSEP  as  well.   
(defunt)  Upd.  by  KoD  &  DtN  &  Crusty  Crab  &  jarredou,  HV  (12.06.23)  (probably  now  requires  !pip  install  numpy==1.26  and  restarting  env)  
It
 
might
 
have
 
more
 
models
 
than
 
above
 
(e.g.
 
some
 
beta
 
HQ
 
ones)
