    3)  viperx  —  04.08.2021  My simple  karaoke  model that  I  trained  in  month  5  until  epoch  25/28  doesn't  complete  the  training  because  I've  been  busy  with  other  projects,  and  I  left  this  one  aside,  but  
this
 
simple
 
model
 
removes
 
the
 
second
 
voice,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
useful
 
in
 
only
 
some
 
cases,
 
it's
 
bad
 
but
 
it's
 
acceptable

Model
 
A
 
cleaner
 
but
 
with
 
more
 
bleeding;
 
Audioshake
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
it,
 
but
 
with
 
different
 
model
 
based
 
on
 
larger
 
dataset
 
iirc,
 
UVR
 
team
 
consider
 
training
 
it
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
bigger
 
dataset
 
to
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
-
 
it’s
 
based
 
on
 
phase
 
unlike
 
UVR,
 
but
 
tsumeruso
 
works
 
on
 
adding
 
phase,
 
so
 
then
 
it
 
might
 
get
 
rewritten
 
to
 
UVR)

similar
 
results,

not
 
the
