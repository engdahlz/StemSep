     Q:  how  come  level  1  will  be  eliminated?  is  it  possible  to  leave  it  since  i  use  this  site  very  little  
and
 
paying
 
(
 
2.79$
 
)
 
per
 
month
 
is
 
too
 
much
 
and
 
anyway
 
360
 
minutes
 
of
 
audio
 
per
 
week
 
is
 
a
 
lot.
 
i
 
do
 
5/
 
6
 
per
 
week.
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
waste
 
of
 
minutes.
  A:  If  you  renew  your  subscription  several  months  in  advance,  you  can  use  Level  1  even  after  
removal.
 
In
 
addition,
 
once
 
your
 
subscription
 
Level
 
1
 
expires,
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
it
 
for
 
another
 
month
 
for
 
free
 
(after
 
removing
 
it
 
in
 
February).
  
Similarity/Phantom  Center/Mid  channel  Extractor  “It  extracts  the  phantom  centre.  I.e.  what  you  hear  as  being  in  front  of  you  in  stereo  audio”  
“very
 
useful
 
for
 
older
 
mixes.
 
Like
 
60s
 
songs
 
with
 
hard
 
panning”
  -  Dry  Paint  Dealer  Undr  (a.k.a.  wesleyr36)  released  new  Phantom  Centre  Models  HTDemucs  Similarity/Phantom  Centre  Extraction  model:  GDrive /  HF /  Colab (it  tends  to  be  more  “correct”  in  center  extraction  than  the  MDX23C  model  below)  That  Demucs  model  won’t  work  with  UVR  giving  bag_num  error  even  with  the  yaml  prepared  
in
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
as
 
for
 
Imagoy
 
Drumsep
 
and
 
after
 
renaming
 
ckpt
 
to
 
th
 
(it’s
 
probably
 
because
 
it
 
needs
 
ZFTurbo
 
inference
 
code
 
it
 
was
 
trained
 
with).

models

work
 
in
 
UVR:
 
 -  iter41_l1_loss  model for  VR  v6.0.0b4 -  similarity/phantom  centre  extractor  by  wesleyr36/drypaintdealerundr,   “I  think  this  arch  makes  for  a  much  better  similarity  extractor  (make  sure  to  use  the  complex  flag  when  running  this  model  --complex  or  -X)”  
 
Compared
 
to
 
MDX23C
 
models
 
below,
 
VR6
 
ones
 
were
 
trained
 
on
 
limited
 
dataset,
 
but
 
they
 
can
 
still
 
perform
 
better.
  -  4096  model for  VR  v6.0.0b4 by  wesleyr36/drypaintdealerundr  (it  should  perform  better  than  the  MDX23C  2048  model  below)  “must  be  run  not  only  with  -X  or  --complex  but  also  --n_fft  4096  --hop_length  2048  or  -f  4096  
-H
 
2048”
 VS  2048  -  “pros:  less  bleed  cons:  less  complete  results  as  a  similarity  extractor
