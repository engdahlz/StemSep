     Excellent  for  training  duet/unison  and  separately  main/rest  vocals.  The  original  code  is  extremely  messy  and  broken  at  the  same  time,  and  dataset  is  big  and  
hard
 
to
 
obtain.
 
Cyrus
 
was
 
to
 
publish
 
their
 
own
 
repository
 
with
 
fixed
 
code
 
and
 
complete
 
dataset
 
at
 
some
 
point.
  The  problem  of  the  model  trained  by  Cyrus  was  training  cutoff  used  while  training.  "The  ISR_net  is  basically  just  a  different  type  of  model  that  attempts  to  make  audio  super  
resolution
 
and
 
then
 
separate
 
it.
 
I
 
only
 
trained
 
it
 
cuz
 
that's
 
what
 
the
 
paper's
 
author
 
did,
 
but
 
it
 
gives
 
worse
 
results
 
than
 
just
 
the
 
normal
 
fine-tuned"

  Apart  from  training  code,  there  wasn't  any  model  released  by  the  authors.  Only  result  
snippets.

well

it
 
seems
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
trained
 
with
 
a

  MossFormer2  may  perform  better   “These  archs  are  not  implement  in  ZF's  script  but  are  really  promising  for  multiple  speakers

prior)
 samples  only:  max  10-20  seconds  input,  otherwise  potential  memory  issues  (so  chunk  a  full  
song
 
into
 
such
 
segments
 
prior)
 Individual  samples  are  not  supported  (so  it's  folder-based,  put  your  samples  in  there)”   Also,  there  are  various  errors  which  some  users  tend  to  encounter,  at  least  on  Windows  
machines.
