    Maybe  if  we  separate  just  snare  with  the  old  MDX23C  model  below  from  an  already  
separated
 
drums
 
stem,
 
and
 
mix/invert
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
rest,
 
then
 
pass
 
it
 
through
 
the
 
new
 
model,
 
the
 
bleed
 
would
 
be
 
gone.
  For  comparison,  metrics of  the  old  6  stem  jarredou/Aufr33  MDX23C  model   (which  has  cymbals  divided  into  ride  and  crash  which  are  not  in  the  evaluation  dataset):  SDR:  kick:  14.55,  snare:  9.79,  toms:  10.64,  hihat:  3.20,  cymbals:  6.08  Metric  fullness  for  snare:  25.0361,  bleedless  for  hh:  10.2765,  log_wmse  for  snare:  12.4258  The  model  was  trained  with  a  lightweight  config  to  train  on  a  subpar  T4  GPU  on  free  Colabs  
and
 
10
 
accounts.
 
The
 
metrics
 
do
 
not
 
surpass
 
exclusive
 
drumsep
 
Mel-Roformer
 
and
 
SCNet
 
models
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
but
 
at
 
least
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
one
 
locally.
  “Depending  on  the  quality  tier  of  input  source  material,  it  can  sometimes  yield  more  accurate  
stem-to-stem
 
separations
 
than
 
either
 
MelRoFormer
 
or
 
SCNet-XL
 
four-or-six
 
stem
 
DrumSep
 
models.
 
(...)
 
 For  example,  I  often  find  that  MelRoFormer  DrumSep  can  leave  the  upper  frequency  range  
of
 
Snare
 
hits
 
and
 
mis-assign
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
Cymbals
 
stem.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
common
 
issue
 
I
 
have
 
encountered
 
with
 
separating
 
AUD
 
recordings
 
with
 
MelRoFormer
 
DrumSep.
 MDX23c  5-stem  drumsep  is  trained  in  such  a  way  that  it  separates  these  snare  remainders  
out
 
of
 
the
 
Cymbals
 
stem,
 
which
 
is
 
extremely
 
useful.
