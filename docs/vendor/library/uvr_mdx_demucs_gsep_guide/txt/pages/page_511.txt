Matchering,
 
output

In  
the
 
video
 
below,
 
the
 
author
 
wanted
 
to
 
make
 
three
 
instrumentals
 
sound
 
like
 
Juice
 
World.
 
One
 
result
 
was
 
decent,
 
in
 
the
 
other
 
one
 
there
 
was
 
an
 
issue
 
with
 
ovecrompressing/overlimiting,
 
so
 
the
 
guitar
 
was
 
fading
 
in/out
 
once
 
some
 
other
 
instrument
 
was
 
kicking
 
in.
 
Some
 
prompts
 
might
 
fail
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
the
 
result
 
file,
 
and
 
he
 
provided
 
the
 
examples.

(wav)
 
into
 
the
 
buffer
 
and
 
thus
 
can't
 
process
 
them.
 
Compared
 
to
 
unstable
 
work
 
results,
 
not
 
working
 
is
 
more
 
serious.”
