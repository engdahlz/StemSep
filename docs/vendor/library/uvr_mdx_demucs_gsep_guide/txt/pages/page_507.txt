    leftovers  from  the  separation  process.  Equalize  Loudness  doesn’t  do  anything  when  
checked
 
just
 
before
 
download
 
(probably
 
only
 
after
 
when
 
you
 
click
 
remaster).
  They  also  have  offline  app:  https://github.com/ai-mastering/phaselimiter-gui/releases/ with  some  features  used  on  Bakuage/aimastering.com  “but  most  of  the  settings  you  want  are  on  their  site,  their  offline  version  is  set  and  forget.  (...)  
doesn't
 
give
 
you
 
some
 
specific
 
settings
 
to
 
adjust.”
  https://moises.ai/ 16-32  bit  WAV  output  (now  WAV  is  only  in  premium),  any  input  formats.  They  have  bad  
separation
 
tools,
 
but
 
great,
 
neutral
 
mastering
 
AI.
 
It
 
works
 
very
 
good
 
for
 
vinyl
 
rips.
 
You
 
can
 
get
 
more
 
than
 
5
 
tracks
 
per
 
month
 
for
 
free
 
(don’t
 
know
 
how
 
many
 
-
 
the
 
5
 
tracks
 
limit
 
is
 
for
 
separation,
 
not
 
for
 
mastering
 
feature,
 
at
 
least
 
30
 
worked
 
in
 
2022).
 The  mastering  feature  is  only  available  in  the  web  version,  so  if  you’re  on  the  phone,  run  the  
site
 
in
 
PC
 
mode.
  24  bit  -9  iLUFS  /  or  without  limiter  does  the  best  job  in  most  cases  for  e.g.  GSEP  (the  latter  is  
when
 
you
 
don’t
 
want
 
to
 
smooth
 
out
 
the
 
sound).
 
-8
 
tends
 
to
 
harm
 
the
 
dynamics
 
of
 
songs,
 
but
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
useful
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
snare
 
louder.
  The  interface  has  a  bug  when  you  need  to  pick  your  file  to  upload  twice,  otherwise  you  won’t  
be
 
able
 
to
 
change
 
parameters
 
and
 
confirm
 
the
 
upload
 
process
 
(also
 
on
 
mobile
 
parameters
 
not
 
always
 
appear
 
immediately
 
after
 
you
 
pick
 
your
 
file/pasted
 
link
 
enlisting
 
the
 
options
 
manually
 
doesn’t
 
let
 
you
 
confirm
 
the
 
step
 
to
 
proceed
 
to
 
upload,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
retry
 
picking
 
the
 
file,
 
and
 
now
 
you
 
can
 
proceed).
  Sometimes  uploading  is  stuck  for  very,  very  long  on  99%  and  if  you  leave  your  phone  in  
sleep
 
mode
 
and
 
return
 
after
 
15
 
minutes,
 
it
 
will
 
start
 
some
 
upload
 
again
 
on
 
this
 
99%,
 
but
 
eventually
 
it
 
will
 
return
 
the
 
error.
 
You
 
simply
 
need
 
to
 
retry
 
uploading
 
the
 
file
 
(it
 
will
 
also
 
stack
 
at
 
99%,
 
but
 
it
 
will
 
still
 
upload
 
at
 
that
 
time).
 
  Also,  importing  the  same  file  via  GDrive  may  not  work.   Additionally,  if  you  pick  32  bit  output  quality,  when  mastering  is  done,  when  you  will  want  to  
download
 
the
 
file,
 
in
 
WAV
 
it
 
will
 
show
 
24
 
bit,
 
but
 
the
 
file
 
will
 
be
 
32
 
bit
 
as
 
you
 
selected
 
before.
  It’s  the  most  neutral  in  sound  in  comparison  to  the  two  below.  If  you  plan  to  master  your  own  music,  read  “Preparing  your  tracks”  here:  https://moises.ai/blog/how-to-master-a-song-home/ I  think  these  tips  are  pretty  universal  for  all  of  these  services.   https://www.mastering.studio/
