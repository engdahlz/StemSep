    Different  mixing  of  the  RB  tracks  was  a  factor  in  models  trained  by  the  community.  “Also,  RB  
tracks
 
never
 
fade
 
out.
 
They
 
are
 
also
 
never
 
brickwalled.”
 “brickwall  audio  has  negative  influence  on  waveform  based  archs,  but  on  spectrogram  based  
one
 
like
 
all
 
recents
 
one,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
to
 
have
 
big
 
impact
 
on
 
results
 
quality”

 toaz.info-stemspdf-pr_7a1e446f01c9b1666a9bebe9fd51f419.pdf (reupload)   Huge  database  (probably  contains  some  of  the  above)  https://songstems.net/   Others :   Multitracks’  section  of  rutracker  (requires  free  account):  https://rutracker.org/forum/tracker.php?f=2492  Multitracks/multitrack  queries  on  The  Pirate  Bay  https://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=multitrack&all=on&search=Pirate+Search&page=0&orderby= https://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=multitracks&all=on&search=Pirate+Search&page=0&orderby=  “You  can  just  go  here  https://rutracker.org/forum/tracker.php?f=1674 (sample  libraries  category)  and  type  the  instrument  you  want,  it  will  pop  all  the  sample  packs.  Maybe  add  "loop"  to  the  search  too,  will  filter  out  some  weird  packs”   Maybe  you  find  something  useful  on  sharemania.us  too  (160  lossy/261  lossless)   Seems  'acapella  tools'  or  'instrumental  tools'  are  good  key-words  to  search  for.  Some  are  covers  of  original  tracks,  but  that  shouldn't  matter,  since  they  represent  the  same.  This  is  on  Deezer,  but  u  might  find  others  on  Tidal.   There’s  also  some  stuff  available  on  Soulseek  (P2P  service)   frp.live  instrumentals/acapellas  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NuQV8cfFPehvIwPBUGOMbiC4FSei2p923qC6af5tCV8/
