                         -  If  the  song  have  BV,  this  you  keep  a  fuller  **Instrumental  Stem  with  BV**  in  it.  
If
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
BV,
 
but
 
there
 
is
 
some
 
Main
 
Vocals
 
bleeding
 
through
 
the
 
Instr,
 
continue
 
to
 
pass
 
2.
  2.  pass  Ensemble:  Kim  Vocal  2  +  Inst  HQ3  +  MDX  Karaoke  2  -  Min/Max                       -  This  pass  will  try  to  preserve  the  BV  in  the  Instrumental  Stem  while  removing  
Main
 
Vocal
 
bleed.
 
You
 
can
 
stop
 
here
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
the
 
**Instrumental
 
Stem
 
with
 
BV**
  3.  pass  Ensemble:  Kim  Inst  +  Inst  HQ3  +  htdemucs  -  Min/Max                       -  This  pass  will  try  to  remove  BV  from  the  instrumental  Stem  and  other  Main  
Vocal
 
Bleed
 
while
 
keep
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
fuller.
  The  idea  behind  it,  is  to  have  less  volume  variation  where  the  vocals  are  extracted,  leaving  
the
 
Instrumental
 
Stem
 
less
 
muddy.
 
Since
 
the
 
extraction
 
of
 
the
 
vocals
 
is
 
done
 
little
 
by
 
little
 
using
 
the
 
Min/Max,
 
the
 
Models
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
so
 
aggressive.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
starting
 
point
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
improve
 
further
 
in
 
a
 
DAW
 
or
 
just
 
sing
 
over
 
it.
 
The
 
Con
 
is
 
that,
 
sometimes,
 
the
 
track
 
will
 
have
 
tiny
 
bleeds.
 
If
 
you
 
try
 
this
 
method,
 
please
 
post
 
the
 
results
 
here.
  #3  -  -try  this  ensemble:  9_HP  (10  agression)  +  HQ3  (chunks  on)  +  demucs_ft,  Min/Max  -  it  preserves  most  of  the  instruments.   M.  Contini  method  #4  (new)   Another  Ensemble  suggestion  for  good  instrumentals  with  minimized  bleeding  vocals  and  a  
bit
 
of
 
noise
 
in
 
some
 
cases:
  Ensemble:  9_HP  +  HQ3  +  Demucs_6s  (secondary  model  50%:  full_292)  -  Algorithm  
[min/max]
  Configs:  9_HP  Window[512],  Agress[10],  TTA[on],  Post[off],  High-End  [off])  HQ3  Chunks[on]  [auto],  Denoise[on],  Spectral[off]  Demucs_6s  Chunks[on]  [auto],  Split[off],  Combine[off],  Spectral[off],  Mixer[off],  Secondary  
Model
 
-
 
Vocals/Instr
 
[MDX-Inst_full_292]
 
[50%]
  Why  Demucs_6s  and  not  _ft  -  I  compare  them  in  some  songs  and  6s  have  less  vocal  bleed  
in
 
the
 
instrumental
 
track.
  Description:  The  idea  is  to  take  the  good  bits  of  the  models  using  only  one  from  each  Group  (VR,  MDX  
and
 
Demucs).
 
The
 
secondary
 
model
 
on
 
Demucs
 
is
 
to
 
minimize
 
some
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
with
 
sustained
 
notes
 
that
 
was
 
happening
 
in
 
some
 
songs.
