    mirroring  is  working  under  high-end  process  -  no  mirroring2  [272  window  size  is  added  back  
as
 
user
 
input]
 
all
 
settings
 
should
 
be
 
available
 
in
 
GUI).
 
Interestingly,
 
I
 
received
 
similar
 
report
 
for
 
MDX
 
models
 
in
 
UVR5
 
GUI
 
comparing
 
to
 
Colab
 
(be
 
aware
 
just
 
in
 
case).
 
The
 
problems
 
might
 
be
 
also
 
bound
 
to
 
VRAM,
 
and
 
don't
 
exist
 
on
 
11GB
 
GPPUs
 
and
 
up
 
or
 
in
 
CPU
 
mode.
  Before  we  start  -   Issue  with  additional  vocal  residues  when  postprocess  is  enabled   -  “ postprocess  option  masks  instrumental  part  based  on  the  vocals  volume  to  improve  the  separation  quality."  (from:  https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover)   where  in  HV  Colab  it  says:  “Mute  low  volume  vocals”.  So,  if  it  enhances  separation  quality,  
then
 
maybe
 
it
 
should
 
cancel
 
some
 
vocals
 
residues
 
("low
 
volume
 
vocals")
 
so
 
that's
 
maybe
 
not
 
too
 
bad
 
explanation.
 
  But  that  setting  enabled  in  at  least  Colab  may  leave  some  vocal  residues:  
 
(it’s
 
fixed
 
in
 
UVR
 
GUI
 
"the
 
very
 
end
 
bits
 
of
 
vocals
 
don't
 
bleed
 
anymore
 
no
 
matter
 
which
 
threshold
 
value
 
is
 
used")
  Customizable  postprocess  settings  (threshold,  min  range  and  fade  size)  in  HV's  Colab  were  
deleted,
 
and
 
were
 
last
 
time
 
available
 
in
 
this
 
revision:
 https://colab.research.google.com/github/NaJeongMo/Colaboratory-Notebook-for-Ultimate-Vocal-Remover/blob/b072ad7418f6b1825d3dcff7cef70c5b0985d540/Vocal%20Remover%205_arch.ipynb#scrollTo=CT8TuXWLBrXF So  change  default  0.3  or  0.2  threshold  value  (depending  on  revision)  and  set  it  to  0.01  if  you  
have
 
the
 
issue
 
when
 
using
 
postprocess.
  The  threshold  parameter  set  to  0.01  fixes  the  issue  (so  quiet  the  opposite  thing  happened  
using
 
default
 
settings
 
than
 
this
 
option
 
should
 
serve
 
to,
 
I
 
believe).
 Also,  default  threshold  values  for  postprocess  changed  from  0.3  to  0.2  in  later  revisions  of  
the
 
Colab.
  -  Window  size  option  set  to  anything  other  than  512  somehow  decrease  SDR,  although  most  
people
 
like
 
lower
 
values
 
(at
 
least
 
320,
 
me
 
even
 
272;
 
352
 
is
 
also
 
possible,
 
but
 
anything
 
above
 
changes
 
the
 
tone
 
of
 
sound
 
more
 
noticeably)
 
-
 
we
 
don’t
 
know
 
yet
 
why
 
lower
 
window
 
sizes
 
mess
 
with
 
SDR
 
(similar
 
situation
 
like
 
with
 
GSEP)
 
-
 
512
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
setting
 
for
 
ensemble
 
with
 
other
 
models
 
than
 
VR
 
ones
 
or
 
for
 
further
 
mastering.
 
Sometimes
 
compared
 
to
 
512
 
windows
 
size,
 
272
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
noticeable
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
You
 
might
 
find
 
bigger
 
window
 
sizes
 
less
 
noisy
 
in
 
general,
 
but
 
also
 
more
 
blurry
 
for
 
some
 
people.
