As  for  2  stems,  it  gives  
very
 
good
 
instrumentals
 
for
 
songs
 
with
 
very
 
loud
 
and
 
harsh
 
vocals
 
and
 
a
 
bit
 
lo-fi
 
hip-hop
 
beats,
 
as
 
it
 
can
 
remove
 
vocals
 
very
 
aggressively.
 
Sometimes
 
even
 
more
 
than
 
HQ_3.
 
The
 
new
 
model
 
might
 
be
 
good
 
at
 
removing
 
SFX
 
(instrumental
 
stem
 
is
 
the
 
old
 
model).
  In  specific  cases  (can  have  more  vocal  residues  in  instrumentals  vs  HQ_3  at  times  -  less  in  
jarredou's
 
Colab):
 -  original  MDX23 by  ZFTurbo  (only  this  OG  version  of  MDX23  still  works  in  the  offline  app,  min.  8GB  Nvidia  card  required  [6GB  with  specific  parameters])  -  sounds  very  clean  though,  
and
 
not
 
that
 
muddy
 
like
 
inst
 
MDX
 
models,
 
in
 
this
 
means,
 
comparable
 
with
 
even
 
VR
 
arch
 
or
 
better
 
(because
 
of
 
much
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues).
  -  Demucs_ft  model  (both  3  stems  to  mix  in  e.g.  Audacity  for  instrumental)  /  sometimes  6s  model  gives  better  results,  or  in  very  specific  cases  when  vocals  are  easy  to  filter  out  -  even  
the
 
old
 
4
 
stem
 
mdx_extra
 
model
 
(but
 
SDR
 
wise
 
full
 
band
 
MDX
 
292
 
is
 
already
 
better
 
than
 
even
 
ft
 
model).
 
The
 
6s
 
model
 
is
 
worth
 
checking
 
with
 
shifts
 
20.
