    https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds)    from  Apple  Music  (MacOS,  virtual  soundcard  recording)   (Guide  by  Mikeyyyyy/K-Kop  Filters,  source)   You  will  need  a  Mac  to  do  this,  this  will  only  work  for  MacOS,  you  will  need  an  Apple  Music  
subscription,
 
"Blackhole
 
16ch"
 
and
 
any
 
DAW
 
of
 
your
 
choice
 
I
 
prefer
 
FL
 
Studio
 
(can
 
be
 
also
 
Audacity),
  Step  1.  Install  Blackhole  Audio  driver  (search  for  it  in  Google)  Step  2.  Download  the  song  you  want  in  Dolby  Atmos  (if  you  don't  know  how  to  do  it,  go  to  
settings
 
in
 
Apple
 
Music
 
then
 
to
 
general
 
then
 
toggle
 
download
 
Dolby
 
Atmos)
  Step  3.  Go  to  your  desired  DAW  and  in  your  mixed  select  input,  and  it  will  show  your  16  
outputs
 
select
 
1,
 
(Mono)
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
mixer,
 
then
 
number
 
2
 
mixer
 
do
 
the
 
same
 
but
 
2
 
and
 
so
 
on
 
until
 
you
 
reached
 
6
  Step  4.  Hit  record  and  play  the  track  in  Dolby,  and  you're  done!   Similar tutorial  based  on  Blackhole  and  Audacity  on  Mac  (open  the  link  in  incognito  in  case  of  infinite  captcha)   “On  latest  MacOS  you  do  now  have  the  ability  to  decode  directly  to  7.1.4  pcm  realtime  from  
Apple
 
Music.
 
If
 
you
 
use
 
a
 
loopback
 
virtual
 
audio
 
driver
 
you
 
can
 
record
 
the
 
12
 
channels.
 
Depending
 
on
 
how
 
song
 
was
 
mixed
 
might
 
mean
 
the
 
C
 
channel
 
has
 
even
 
even
 
clearer
 
vocal.
 Probably  worth  mentioning  Dolby  Atmos  is  delivered  as  dd+  (Dolby  Digital  5.1  Surround  
downmix)
 
but
 
JOC
 
allows
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
decoded
 
up
 
to
 
9.1.6
 
16
 
channels.
 
To
 
do
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
either
 
an
 
AVR
 
or
 
Dolby
 
Reference
 
Player
 
or
 
Cavern/Cavernize.”

  You  won't  be  able  to  do  the  same  on  Windows  with  LoopBeAudio instead  (paid,  but  trial  works  for  every  60  minutes  after  boot)  because  Apple  Music  on  Windows  (including  the  one  
in
 
MS
 
Store)
 
doesn't
 
provide
 
Dolby
 
Atmos
 
(7.3.1)
 
files
 
at
 
all
 
(only
 
stereo
 
hi-res
 
lossless)
 
no
 
matter
 
what
 
virtual
 
soundcard
 
you
 
use,
 
so
 
you'll
 
need
 
Hackintosh
 
or
 
VMware.

though.
