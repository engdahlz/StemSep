    -  When  you  see  loop  of  redirections  when  you  just  logged,  and  you  see  Sign  In  (?~go  to  main  page)  simply  enter  the  main  link  https://studio.gaudiolab.io/gsep  -  If  you’re  getting  mp3  with  bitrate  lower  than  320kbps  which  is  base  maximum  quality  in  
this
 
service
 
(but
 
you
 
get
 
112/128/224
 
output
 
mp3
 
instead)
 
  >  Probably  your  input  file  is  lossy  48kHz  or/and  in  lower  bitrate  than  320kbps  >  your  file  must  
be
 
at
 
least
 
mp3
 
320kbps
 
44kHz
 
(and
 
not
 
48kHz).
 
The
 
same
 
issue
 
exists
 
for
 
URL
 
option
 
and
 
for
 
Opus
 
file
 
downloaded
 
from
 
YouTube
 
when
 
you
 
rename
 
it
 
to
 
m4a
 
to
 
process
 
it
 
in
 
GSEP.
 
To
 
sum
 
up
 
-
 
GSEP
 
will
 
always
 
match
 
bitrate
 
of
 
the
 
input
 
file
 
to
 
the
 
output
 
file
 
if
 
it’s
 
lower
 
than
 
320kbps.
 
To
 
avoid
 
this,
 
use
 
lossless
 
44kHz
 
file
 
or
 
if
 
you
 
can’t,
 
convert
 
your
 
lossy
 
file
 
to
 
WAV
 
32
 
bit
 
(resample
 
Opus
 
to
 
44kHz
 
as
 
well
 
-
 
it’s
 
always
 
48kHz,
 
for
 
YT
 
files,
 
don’t
 
download
 
AAC/m4a
 
files
 
-
 
they
 
have
 
cutoff
 
at
 
16kHz
 
while
 
Opus
 
at
 
20kHz).
 
Now
 
you
 
should
 
get
 
320kbps
 
mp3
 
as
 
usual
 
without
 
any
 
worse
 
cutoff
 
than
 
20kHz
 
for
 
mp3
 
320kbps.
 
 If  you  still  not  get  320kbps,  try  using  incognito  mode/VPN/new  account  (at  best  all  three  at  
the
 
same
 
time).
 
 You  can  use  Foobar2000  for  resampling  e.g.  Opus  file  (RBM  on  file  in  
playlist>convert>processing>resampler>44100.
 
And
 
in
 
output
 
file
 
format>WAV>32
 
bit).
 
Don’t
 
download
 
from
 
YT
 
in
 
any
 
other
 
audio
 
than
 
Opus,
 
otherwise
 
it
 
will
 
have
 
16kHz
 
cutoff
 
and
 
separation
 
result
 
will
 
be
 
worse.
  -  (fixed)  Also  on  mobile,  the  file  may  not  appear  on  your  list  after  upload,  and  you  need  to  
refresh
 
the
 
site.
  -  If  FLAC  persists  to  be  stuck  in  the  "Uploading"  screen,  try  converting  it  to  WAV  (32-bit  float  
at
 
best)
  -  Check  this video  for  fixing  issues  in  missing  sounds  in  stems  (known  issue  with  GSEP)   -  GSEP  separation  results  don't  begin  at  the  same  time  signature  like  UVR  results.   >  In  order  to  fix  it,  convert  mp3  to  WAV  or  align  stems  manually  if  you  need  it  for  some  
comparisons
 
or
 
manual
 
ensemble.
 
Also
 
some
 
DAWs
 
can
 
correct
 
it
 
automatically
 
on
 
import.
  Eventually  hit  their  Discord server  and  report  any  issues  (but  they’re  pretty  much  inactive  lately).    Remarks  about  quality  of  separation   “The  main  difference  (vs  old  model)  is  the  vocals.  I  can't  say  for  sure  if  they're  better  than  
before,
 
but
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
difference,
 
the
 
"others"
 
and
 
"bass"
 
are
 
also
 
different.
 
Only
 
the
 
drums
 
remain
 
the
 
same.
 
Generally
 
better,
 
but
 
the
 
difference
 
is
 
not
 
massive,
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
song”
