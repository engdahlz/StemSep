[page 120/642]
    -  The  ensembles  for  2  and  5  stems  on  MVSEP  have  been  updated  with  bigger  SDR  bag  of  
models
 
containing
 
now
 
new
 
BS-Roformer
 
v2
 
(with
 
MDX23C,
 
VitLarge23,
 
and
 
for
 
multistem,
 
the
 
old
 
demucsht_ft,
 
deumcs_ht,
 
demucs_6s
 
and
 
demucs_mmi
 
models)
  -  All  the  Discord  direct  links  leading  to  images  in  this  document  have  expired.  I  already  
reuploaded
 
some
 
more
 
important
 
stuff.
 
Please
 
ping
 
me
 
on
 
Discord
 
if
 
you
 
need
 
access
 
to
 
some
 
specific
 
image.
 
Provide
 
page
 
and
 
expired
 
link.
  -  https://free-mp3-download.net has  been  shut  down.  Check  out  alternatives  here.  New  Apple  Music  ALAC/Atmos  downloader  added,  but  its  installation  is  a  bit  twisted  and  
subscription
 
is
 
required.
 
Murglar
 
added.
  -  MDX-Net  HQ_4  model  (SDR  15.86)  released  for  UVR  5  GUI!  Go  to  Models  list>Download  
center>MDX-Net
 
and
 
pick
 
HQ_4
 
for
 
download.
 
It
 
is
 
an
 
improved
 
and
 
faster
 
than
 
HQ_3,
 
trained
 
for
 
epoch
 
1149
 
(only
 
in
 
rare
 
cases
 
there’s
 
more
 
vocal
 
bleeding,
 
more
 
often
 
instrumental
 
bleeding
 
in
 
vocals,
 
but
 
the
 
model
 
is
 
made
 
with
 
instrumentals
 
in
 
mind.
 
 Along  with  it,  also  UVR-MDX-NET  Crowd  HQ  1  has  been  added  in  download  center.   -  HQ_4  model  added  to  the  Colab:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/kae0-0/Colab-for-MDX_B/blob/main/MDX_Colab.ipynb  -  New  BS-Roformer  v2  model  released  on  MVSEP.  It’s  more  aggressive  model  than  above.   -  Fixed KaraFan  Colab  with  the  fix  for  slow  non-MDX23  models.  You'll  no  longer  stack  on  voc_ft  using  any  other  preset  than  1,  but  be  aware  that  it  will  take  8  minutes  more  to  
initialize.
 
(same
 
fix
 
as
 
suggested
 
before,
 
but
 
w/o
 
console,
 
as
 
it
 
wasn't
 
defined,
 
and
 
faster
 
ort
 
nightly
 
fix
 
doesn't
 
work
 
here).
  Turns  out,  there  has  been  an  official  non-nightly  package  released,  and  it  works  with  
KaraFan
 
correctly
 
(no
 
need
 
to
 
wait
 
8
 
minutes
 
any
 
longer):
 !python  -m  pip  -q  install  onnxruntime-gpu  --extra-index-url
