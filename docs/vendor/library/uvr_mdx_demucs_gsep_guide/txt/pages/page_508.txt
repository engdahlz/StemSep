    Four  presets  with  live  preview,  only  16  bit  WAV  for  free,  only  WAV  as  input  accepted  (for  the  
best
 
quality
 
convert
 
any
 
mp3’s
 
to
 
WAV
 
32-bit
 
float
 
(you
 
can
 
use
 
Foobar2000),
 
64
 
bit
 
WAV
 
input
 
unsupported).
 If  you  see  "upload  failed",  register  and  activate  a  new  account  in  incognito  mode  and  
everything
 
using
 
VPN
 
(probably
 
a
 
block
 
for
 
ISP
 
which
 
I
 
had).
 Judging  by  only  16  bit  output  quality  (which  is  unfair  comparison  to  24  bit  on  moises.ai)  and  
for
 
GSep
 
320kbps
 
files,
 
I
 
found
 
it
 
worse,
 
and
 
even
 
the
 
London
 
smooth
 
preset
 
is
 
not
 
so
 
neutral
 
like
 
moises
 
in
 
overall,
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
destructive
 
to
 
the
 
sound
 
quality.
 
But,
 
if
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
something
 
extra
 
from
 
the
 
mix
 
if
 
it’s
 
blurry,
 
that’s
 
a
 
good
 
choice
 
(while
 
some
 
people
 
can
 
find
 
emastered
 
too
 
pricy).
  BandLab  Assistant  mastering  First,  you  need  to  download  their  assistant  here:  https://www.bandlab.com/products/desktop/assistant Then  insert  the  file,  pick  preset,  listen,  and  then  it  is  uploaded  for  further  processing,  and  
you’re
 
redirected
 
to
 
the
 
download
 
page.
  They  write  more  about  it  below:  https://www.bandlab.com/mastering Four  presets  -  CD,  enhance,  bass  boost,  max  16  bit  WAV  output  only.  In  comparison  to  paid  
emastered,
 
it’s
 
average.
 
But
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
it’s
 
better
 
than
 
free
 
mastering.studio
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
muffled
 
snare
 
in
 
the
 
instrumental.
 
On
 
GSEP
 
only
 
CD
 
preset
 
was
 
usable.
 
The
 
sound
 
is
 
more
 
crusty
 
than
 
even
 
LA
 
Punch
 
-
 
more
 
saturated
 
(less
 
neutral)
 
a
 
bit
 
too
 
bassy
 
and
 
compressed,
 
but
 
it
 
may
 
work
 
in
 
some
 
songs
 
where
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
a
 
better
 
choice
 
and
 
all
 
above
 
failed.
  If  your  file  doesn’t  start  uploading  (hangs  on  “Preparing  Master”),  make  sure  you  don't  have  
“Set
 
as
 
a
 
metered
 
connection”
 
option
 
enabled
 
in
 
W10/11.
 
If
 
yes,
 
disable
 
it,
 
and
 
restart
 
the
 
assistant.
 Straight  after  your  file  is  done  uploading,  it  is  being  processed,  so  don’t  bother  going  to  
BandLab
 
site
 
too
 
fast
 
-
 
sometimes
 
it’s
 
being
 
processed
 
even
 
after
 
download
 
button
 
appeared,
 
where
 
you
 
start
 
waiting
 
in
 
a
 
queue
 
even
 
few
 
minutes
 
after
 
you
 
press
 
the
 
WAV
 
button
 
later,
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
not
 
make
 
this
 
any
 
faster.
  On  the  side.  The  audio  you  hear  during  preview  is  not  exactly  the  same  as  in  result  
downloaded
 
from
 
the
 
site.
 
Preview
 
is
 
a
 
bit
 
louder,
 
and
 
stresses
 
vocal
 
residues
 
more,
 
and
 
snare
 
is
 
less
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
mix,
 
although
 
the
 
file
 
is
 
more
 
clear,
 
sadly
 
it’s
 
also
 
16
 
bit,
 
in
 
overall
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
better.
 
Also,
 
the
 
file
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
stored
 
locally
 
anywhere.
 
But
 
if
 
you’re
 
desperate
 
enough
 
to
 
get
 
this
 
preview,
 
fasten
 
your
 
seatbelt.
 
If
 
you
 
processed
 
more
 
files
 
before,
 
close
 
the
 
assistant,
 
and
 
open
 
again,
 
now
 
process
 
the
 
file,
 
so
 
preview
 
can
 
be
 
played,
 
pause
 
it.
 On  Windows  go  to  task  manager,  go  to  details,  sort  by  CPU,  RBM  on  BandLab  Assistant.exe  
(the
 
one
 
with
 
the
 
most
 
memory
 
occupied)>Create
 
dump
 
file.
 
Open
 
it
 
in
 
HXD
 
(located
 
in
 
temp),
 
write
 
in
 
bytes
 
per
 
row
 
instead
 
of
 
“16”,
 
“4000”,
 
find
 
string
 
“RIFF,”.
 
If
 
you
 
cannot
 
find
 
it,
