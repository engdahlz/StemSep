    -  Drumsep -  “Using  DrumSep  on  melodic  stems  can  help  separate  instruments  easier  if  you  plan  on  sampling/editing  them,  but  they  are  separated  based  on  range  rather  than  actual  
instrument.
 
Low
 
instruments
 
will
 
often
 
be
 
on
 
the
 
kick/tom
 
stems,
 
mid
 
instruments
 
will
 
be
 
on
 
snare
 
and/or
 
tom,
 
and
 
higher
 
instruments
 
will
 
be
 
on
 
the

  De-reverb  -  Mel-Roformer  de-reverb  by  anvuew  v2  (a.k.a.  19.1729  SDR)  |  DL |  config |  Colab Probably  the  best  de-reverb  for  now.   -  and  RX11's  dialogue  isolate  for  de-echo.  
 “anvuew's  models  can  remove  reverb  effect  only  from  vocals,  “captures  early  reflections  a  
little”.
 
Old
 
FoxJoy's
 
model
 
works
 
with
 
full
 
track.”
 “sort  of  reminds  of  RX11  dialogue  dereverb  results  but  doesn't  destroy  singing  voices”  
“perfect
 
for
 
rvc”
 
Both

and

variant
 
“will
 
also
 
remove
 
harmonies
 
or
 
vocal
 
effects
 
that
 
are
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
center
 
channel.”
 “it  works  sort  of  like  that phantom  center  model,  removing  sides  basically”  Sometimes  "noreverb"  stem  might  get  empty  (e.g.  on  MVSEP,  but  similar  issues  was  fixed  
already
 
once
 
there).
 “reminds  me  of  the  equivalent  dereverb  mdx  model  (...)  cleaner  in  some  ways,  though  
slightly
 
more
 
filtered
 
and
 
aggressive.”
 “it's  EXTREMELY  aggressive,  like  very  aggressive,  it  seems  kinda  muddy  at  a  lot  of  parts,  
almost
 
NO
 
reverb
 
bleed,
 
it
 
also
 
caught
 
so
 
many
 
effects
 
and
 
removed
 
them
 
(good
 
thing)
 
which
 
is
 
actually
 
insane!!
 
i
 
also
 
noticed
 
that
 
when
 
it
 
gets
 
breathy
 
or
 
like
 
it
 
has
 
falsetto,
 
it
 
seems
 
to
 
remove
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
it,
 
it's
 
very
 
weird
 
at
 
the
 
breathy-ish
 
parts
 
of
 
it
 
lol,
 
will
 
be
 
using
 
this
 
mainly
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
heavy
 
vocal
 
effects
 
i
 
want
 
removing”

  To  make  it  work  with  UVR,  delete  “linear_transformer_depth:  0”  from  the  YAML  file,  copy  the

to
 
MDX_Net_Models
 
and
 
config
 
to
