Demucs  3   for  4  stems   (SDR  7.7  for  4  stems,  it’s  better  than  Spleeter  (which  is  SDR  6.5-7),  or  better  than  MDX  4  
stem.
 
In
 
most
 
cases,
 
it’s
 
even
 
better
 
than

 Accompanied  by  MDX-UVR  9.7  vocal  model,  it  gives  very  good  4  stem  separation  results  (For  Demucs  4  a.k.a  "htdemucs"  check  below)   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyEe0m8t5b3i9FQkCl_iy6c9maF2brGx?usp=sharing (by  txmutt),  alternatively  with  float32 here  Or  https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/demucs Or  https://mvsep.com/ Pick  up  from  the  list  Demucs  Model  B  there.  You  can  export  result  files  in  MP3  320kbps,  WAV  and  FLAC.  File  limit  is  100MB  and  has  a  
10
 
minute
 
audio
 
length
 
limit.

  In  Colab,  judging  by  quality  of  drums  track,  I  prefer  using  overlap  0.1  (only  for  instrumentals),  
but
 
default
 
set
 
by
 
the
 
author
 
is
 
0.25
 
and
 
is
 
better
 
for
 
sound
 
of
 
instrumental
 
as
 
a
 
whole.
 But  it  still  provides  decent  results  with  instrumentals.  Also,  HV  had  overall  better  separation  quality  results  using  shifts=10,  but  it  increases  
separation
 
time
 
(it's
 
also
 
reflected
 
by
 
MVSEP's
 
SDR
 
calculations).
 
Later
 
we
 
found
 
out
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
further
 
increased
 
to
 
20.
  Also,  I  have  a  report  that  you  may  get  better  results  in  Demucs  using  previously  separated  
instrumental
 
from
 
e.g.
 
UVR.
  Anjok’s  tip  for  better  instrumentals:  “I  recommend  removing  the  drums  with  the  Demucs,  then  
removing
 
the
 
vocals
 
and
 
then
 
mixing
 
the
 
drums
 
back
 
in”.
 
Yields
 
much
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
simple
 
ensemble.
 It  works  the  best  in  cases  when  drums  get  muffled  after  isolation,  e.g.  in  hip-hop.  You  need  
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
tracks
 
are
 
aligned
 
correctly.
 
E.g.
 
if
 
you
 
isolate
 
drumless
 
UVR
 
track,
 
isolate
 
also
 
regular
 
track
 
to
 
align
 
drumless
 
UVR
 
track
 
easier
 
with
 
drums
 
track
