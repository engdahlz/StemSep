    "much  less  muddy  (...)  but  carries  the  exact  same  UVR  noise  from  the  [MDX-Net  v2]  
models"
 But  it's  a  different  type  of  noise,  so  aufr33  denoiser  won't  work  on  it.   “you  can  "remove"  [the]  noise  with  UVR-Denoise,  aggr.  -10  or  0”  although  at  least  with  -10  it  
will
 
make
 
it
 
sound
 
more
 
muddy
 
like
 
Kim
 
model
 
and
 
synths
 
and
 
bass
 
are
 
sometimes
 
removed
 
with
 
the
 
denoiser
 
(~becruily).
 
UVR-Denoise-Lite
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
damage
 
instruments
 
that
 
badly,
 
but
 
still
 
more
 
than

stress
 
the

more,

UVR-Denoise
 
on
 
x-minus
 
is
 
even
 
less
 
aggressive
 
(it’s
 
medium

it
 
might

occasionally.

a

You

 like  on  this  example  ~jarredou  “It's  because  of  the  PHASE.  I  found  a  way  to  fix  it.  Today  I  will  add  a  new  ensemble  button.”    -  Similarity  /  Phantom  Center  Extractor  model by  wesleyr36  added  on  MVSEP  (Experimental  section)  and  x-minus.pro  (Extract  backing  vocals).   “This  model  is  similar  to  the  Center  Channel  Extractor  effect  in  Adobe  Audition  or  Center  
Extract
 
in
 
iZotope
 
RX
 
[and
 
Audacity/Bertom],
 
but
 
works
 
better.
 
 Although  it  does  not  isolate  vocals,  it  can  be  useful.”  Aufr33  You  can  find  more  on  the  topic  in  Similarity  Extractor section.   -  ZFTurbo  released  MVSEP  Wind  model  on  the  site  (MelBand/SCNet/ensemble)  Some  songs  might  be  separated  better  vs  the  model  on  x-minus,  not  all.   -  A  GUI  for  ZFTurbo's  Music  Source  Separation  script  for  inference  called  MSST-GUI  was
