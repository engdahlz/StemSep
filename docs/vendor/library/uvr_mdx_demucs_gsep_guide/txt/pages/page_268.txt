    song.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  when  the  vocal  is  deleted,  the  vocal  melody  is  also  
destroyed.
 
Although
 
it
 
seems
 
like
 
a
 
good
 
idea
 
at
 
first,
 
when
 
we
 
listen
 
to
 
music
 
that
 
is
 
only
 
instrumental
 
with
 
the
 
vocals
 
deleted,
 
that
 
song
 
loses
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
its
 
identity.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
learn
 
how
 
we
 
can
 
preserve
 
the
 
vocal
 
melody
 
after
 
deleting
 
the
 
vocal.
 
What
 
I
 
mean
 
is,
 
can
 
we
 
divide
 
the
 
song
 
into
 
instrumental
 
and
 
vocal
 
and
 
then
 
turn
 
the
 
melody
 
of
 
the
 
vocal
 
part
 
into
 
an
 
instrument
 
such
 
as
 
piano,
 
bass
 
guitar,
 
flute,
 
etc.
 
Then,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
combine
 
this
 
vocal
 
melody
 
with
 
the
 
instrumental
 
result.”

  A:  You  could  try  out  some  older,  less  aggressive  models  than  Roformers.  Even  GSEP.   They  can  sometimes  leave  some  melody  from  vocals  (in  fact,  some  quiet  harmonies),  so  the  
song
 
is
 
not
 
so
 
"dead"
 
after
 
separation.
 
Actually,
 
you
 
could
 
try
 
to
 
separate
 
vocals
 
into
 
separate
 
stems
 
to
 
look
 
for
 
something
 
useful
 
to
 
mix
 
with
 
the
 
instrumental
 
quietly.
 Check  Vocal  models,  then  separate  further  with  BV/Karaoke  models  or  alternatively  check  
GSEP,
 
MDX-Net
 
and
 
maybe
 
even
 
VR
 
models.
