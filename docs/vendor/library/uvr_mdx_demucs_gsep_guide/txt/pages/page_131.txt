     Some  people  cannot  find  the  settings  on  this  screen  in  order  to  separate.  Maybe  it’s  due  to  lack  of  Chinese  IP,  or  Chinese  regional  settings  in  Windows,  but  logging  wasn’t  necessary

  -  AudioSep  has  been  released  https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep (separate  anything  you  describe)  https://replicate.com/cjwbw/audiosep?prediction=j7dsrvtbyxfm3gjax3vfzbf7py (use  short  fragments  as  input)  https://colab.research.google.com/github/badayvedat/AudioSep/blob/main/AudioSep_Colab.ipynb (basic  Colab)  https://huggingface.co/spaces/badayvedat/AudioSep (it’s  down)   "so  far  it's  ranged  from  mediocre  to  absolutely  horrible  from  samples  I've  tried"  "So  far[,]  it  does  [a]  great  job  with  crowd  noise/cheering."  Didn't  pick  piano.   Output  is  mono  32kHz.  Where  input  is  30s,  the  output  can  be  5s.   -  UVR  started  to  process  slower  for  some  people  using  Nvidia  532  and  535  drivers  (at  least  Studio  ones  on  at  least  W11).  More about  the  issue.  Consider  rolling  back  to  531.79.  “Took  10  seconds  to  run  Karaoke  2  on  a  full  song  (~5[]mins),  with  the  latest  drivers  it  took  
like
 
20
 
minutes”.

 Currently,  GPU  memory  is  not  clearing,  so  you  need  a  lot  of  VRAM  in  order  to  use  
ensembles.
