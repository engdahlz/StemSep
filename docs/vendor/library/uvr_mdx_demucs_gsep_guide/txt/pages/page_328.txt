    -If  you  have  x-minus  subscription,  you  can  use  chain  mode  for  Karaoke  as  it  currently  gives  
the
 
best
 
results
  How  it  probably  works  under  the  hood?  "On  sitting  down  and  reading   https://discord.com/channels/708579735583588363/900904142669754399/1071599186350440540 It's  a  multistep  process  where  it  mixes  a  little  bit  from  MDX's  split  vocals  and  instruments.  Then  passes  that  mixture  through  the  UVR  v2  karaoke/backing  vocals  model.  Then  with  those  results,  it  inverts  the  separated  lead  vocal,  and  adds  it  to  the  instrumental  
result"
  -  As  for  4  stem  separation ,  check  GSEP  or  Demucs  4  (now  check  better  MDX23  Colab  by  jarredou)  (other  stem  is  usually  the  best  in  GSEP,  bass  in  Demucs  4,  rest  depends  also  on  a  song,  
and
 
as
 
for
 
drums,
 
if
 
you
 
further
 
process
 
them
 
in
 
DAW
 
using
 
plugins,
 
then
 
Demucs
 
4
 
is
 
usually
 
better
 
as
 
it's
 
lossless
 
and
 
supports
 
up
 
to
 
32-bit
 
float
 
output).
  Demucs  4  has  also  experimental  6  stem  feature.  Guitar  (can  give  good  results)  and  piano  
(it's
 
bad
 
and
 
worse
 
than
 
GSEP).
  -  As  for  free  electric  guitar  and  piano  stems,  currently  GSEP  and  MVSEP  models  are  the  
best,
 
but
 
paid
 
Audioshake
 
provides
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
GSEP.
 
Also
 
in
 
GSEP
 
"when
 
the
 
guitar
 
model
 
works
 
(and
 
it
 
grabs
 
the
 
electric),
 
the
 
remaining
 
'other'
 
stem
 
often
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
way
 
to
 
hear
 
acoustic
 
guitar
 
layers
 
that
 
are
 
otherwise
 
hidden.".
 
LALAL.AI
 
also
 
has
 
piano
 
model
 
and
 
is
 
“drastically”
 
better
 
than
 
Demucs.
  -  From  paid  solutions  for  separating  drums'  sections,  there  are  FactorSynth,  UnmixingStation,  or  free  Drumsep (but  rather  use  MDX23C  model).   -  As  for  specific  sounds  separation,  check  Zero  Shot  Audio.   ______   Cutoffs  examination  with  spectrograms  for  various  models  and  AIs,  available  in  UVR5  GUI,
