    “After  separation,  UVR  cuts  off  the  frequencies  at  15  kHz,  so  I  found  that  to  fix  that  is  to  
invert
 
the
 
"Vocals"
 
and
 
mix
 
that
 
with
 
the
 
original
 
audio
 
file.”
 Demonstration:  Original |  Dereverbed |  Detected  reverb)   -  To  enhance  the  result  if  necessary,  you  can  use  more  layers  of  models  to  dereverb  vocals,  
e.g.:
 Demucs  +  karaoke  model  +  De-reverb  HQ  (by  FoxyJoy)   "works  wonders  on  some  of  this  stuff".   “Originally  I  inverted  with  instrumentals  then  I  ran  through  deecho  dereverb  at  10  aggression  
then
 
demucs_ft
 
then

then

aggression
 
and
 
finally
 
deecho
 
normal”

  -  For  room  reverb  check  out:  Reverb  HQ  then  De-echo  models  (J2)   “from  my  experience,  De-Reverb  HQ  specifically  only  really  works  when  the  sound  is  panned  
in
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
the
 
stereo
 
field
 
perfectly
 
with
 
no
 
phase
 
differences
 
or
 
effects
 
or
 
anything
 
that
 
could
 
cause
 
the
 
sound
 
to
 
be
 
out
 
of
 
phase
 
in
 
certain
 
frequencies.
 If  the  sound  doesn't  fit  that  criteria,  it  only  accurately  produces  the  output  of  whatever’s  in  the  
mid”
  “I  noticed  that  in  some  cases  the  DeEcho  normal  worked  better  than  the  aggressive,  which  
was
 
weird.
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
ran
 
through
 
both,
 
so
 
to
 
remove
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible.”
