    ia_mpeghd_testbench.exe  -ifile:"input  file  name.m4a"  -ofile:"output  file  name.wav"  -cicp:13  “renders  to  22.2  as  well”  https://mpegh.lze-innovation.de/#LZE But  seems  like  you  need  to  write  them  some  message.  Above  it  tells  it's  for  professionals,  but  try  your  luck:  https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/ff/amm/broadcast-streaming/mpegh.html?source=post_page You  should  also  have  a  success  with  extracting  stems  with  MMH  Atmos  Helper  “includes  a  
MPEG-H
 
decoder
 
built-in
 
apparently”
 ---------------------------   All  Dolby  Atmos  is  encoded,  so  to  play  it,  basically  it  has  to  be  decoded  to  audio  playback  
through
 
a
 
Dolby
 
licensed
 
decoder.
 
There
 
are
 
ways
 
to
 
decode,
 
though.
 
Easiest
 
is
 
to
 
use
 
Cavern.
 https://cavern.sbence.hu/cavern/ Atmos  is  a  lossy  format.  768kbps  across  6  channels  so  not  the  highest  resolution,  but  to  
decode
 
to
 
multichannel
 
.wav
 
just
 
download
 
cavern
 
and
 
put
 
your
 
dd+joc
 
file
 
through
 
Cavernize.
 
Streamed
 
Atmos
 
[is
 
lossy].
 
TrueHD
 
Atmos
 
isn't.
 
Atmos
 
Music
 
is
 
only
 
distributed
 
lossy,
 
though.
 You  can  encode  Dolby  Atmos  to  Ambisonics  by  e.g.  https://www.mach1.tech/.    Atmos  files  downloaded  from  Tidal  with  OrpheusDL  are  simply  FLACs  in  m4a  container,  and  
can
 
be
 
read
 
by
 
MPC-HC,
 
VLC,
 
and
 
Foobar
 
2.x.
  On  the  side,  “The  process  of  making  Atmos  [ from  an  engineer  standpoint ]  is:  DAW  >  128  channel  ADM_BWF  >  7.1.4  >5.1(joc).  So  basically  those  128  channels  are  
encoded
 
to
 
6,
 
but
 
the
 
object
 
audio
 
is
 
still
 
known
 
where
 
it
 
should
 
exist
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
and
 
pulls
 
that
 
audio
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
5.1
 
channels
 
to
 
make
 
up
 
to
 
9.1.6
 
(max
 
supported
 
for
 
music)”
  And  authoring  for  Atmos  is  not  available  on  Windows  but:  “Traditionally  it's  not  been  unless  you  ordered  a  DELL  from  Dolby  configured  to  use  as  a  
Rendering
 
machine,
 
but
 
today
 
both
 
Dolby
 
Atmos
 
Renderer,
 
DAWs
 
like
 
Cubase
 
and
 
Nuendo
 
and
 
3rd
 
party
 
VST
 
exist
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
on
 
Windows
 
now.
 
I
 
use
 
Fiedler
 
Atmos
 
Composer
 
on
 
a
 
stereo
 
DAW
 
called
 
Bitwig
 
to
 
build
 
demix
 
projects
 
for
 
Atmos
 
engineers
 
to
 
then
 
master
 
to
 
Atmos
 
from
 
Stereo
 
(sometimes
 
all
 
they
 
have
 
left
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
as
 
multitrack
 
tapes
 
lost/destroyed/politics/easier)”

360  Reality  Audio  FAQ   “A  lot  more  stems  in  360,  and  it  has  no  bleeding  or  filtered  sounding  artifacts.  A  big  problem  with  Dolby  stems  is  artifacts,  essentially  none  of  that  in  360.
