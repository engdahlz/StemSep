    -  (x-minus)  “Added  mixing  of  MDX23C  and  BS-RoFormer  results  (avg/bs-roformer  option).  
So

it

organ,
 
trumpet,
 
vocals)
 
with

 “this  looks  more  like  it's  mixing  different  real  instruments,  rather  than  actually  making  up  
songs

  -  Ensemble  on  MVSEP  updated   -  The  site  is  up  and  running  after  some  outage   -  ZFTurbo  released  fine-tuned  viperx  model  (“ver.  2024.04”)  on  MVSEP  (further  trained  from  
checkpoint
 
on
 
a
 
different
 
dataset).
 
Ensembles

 SDR  vocals:  11.24,  instrumental:  17.55  (from  17.17  in  the  base  model)  Depends  on  a  song  if  it’s  better.  Some  vocals  can  be  worse  vs  the  previous  model.   -  Test  out  ensemble  1296  +  1143  (BS-Roformer  in  beta  UVR)  +  Inst  HQ4  (dopfunk)  Ensembles  with  BS-Roformer  models  might  not  work  for  everyone,  use  manual  ensemble  if  
needed.
  -  Viperx  model  added  also  to  beta  Colab  by  jarredou.  It  gives  only  vocals,  so  perform
