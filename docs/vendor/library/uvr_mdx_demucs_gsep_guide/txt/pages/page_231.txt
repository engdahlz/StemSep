    “really  hard  to  tell  the  difference  between  this  and  becruily's  karaoke  model”  minus  the  latter  
has
 
more
 
target
 
stems.
  -  BVE  v2  model  on  x-minus.pro/uvronline.app  for  premium  users  |  model (“4band_v4_ms_fullband”  stock  config)  by  Aufr33  Place  the  model  file  in  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\VR_Models  and  config file  in  lib_v5\vr_network\modelparams.  Then  pick  “4band_v4_ms_fullband.json”  and  BV  when  
asked
 
to
 
recognize
 
the
 
model
 
(it
 
has
 
the
 
same
 
checksum
 
as
 
in
 
modelparams
 
folder
 
if
 
it’s
 
there
 
already).
 
Also,
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
VR
 
5.1
 
model.
 “Note  that  this  model  should  be  used  with  a  rebalanced  mix.   The  recommended  music  level  is  no  more  than  25%  or  -12  dB.  If  you  use  this  model  in  your  project,  please  credit  me.”  
(it's
 
v1
 
version
 
is
 
also
 
added
 
in
 
UVR’s
 
“Download
 
More
 
Models”,
 
but
 
also
 
without
 
the
 
stereo
 
width
 
feature
 
which
 
can
 
fix
 
some
 
issues
 
when
 
BVs
 
are
 
confused
 
with
 
other
 
vocals).
 On  x-minus  “When  you  select  stereo,  it  applies  a  stereo  narrower  before  AI  processing.”  (sometimes  it  might  work  for  lead,  sometimes  for  back  vocals)  It  used  to  be  one  of  the  best  models  so  far.  On  x-minus  it  used  voc_ft  for  all  vocals  as  a  
preprocessor
 
already.
 "Seems  to  begin  a  phrase  with  a  bit  of  confusion  between  lead  and  backing,  but  then  kicks  in  
with
 
better
 
separation
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
phrase."
 “If  something  struggles  to  separate  on  bve  v2  I  change  the  lv  panning  option  to  either  50  or  
80%
 
[stereo
 
or
 
center],
 
and
 
it
 
separates
 
it
 
amazingly.
 It  even  allows  me  to  separate  backing  backing  vocals  from  backing  vocals”  "BVE  sounds  good  for  now  but  being  an  (U)VR  model  the  vocals  are  soft  (it  doesn’t  extract  
hard
 
sounds
 
like
 
K,
 
T,
 
S
 
etc.
 
very
 
well)"
