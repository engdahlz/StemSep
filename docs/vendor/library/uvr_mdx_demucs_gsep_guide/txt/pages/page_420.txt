    The  download  may  fail  frequently,  forcing  you  to  resume  the  download  multiple  times  in  
browser
 
manually,
 
or
 
wait
 
a
 
bit
 
on
 
the

the
 
start.
  Free  option  of  separating  has  been  removed  since  the  May  2024  update.  There's  only  a  
20-minute
 
free
 
trial
 
with
 
mp3
 
output.
  Vocals  and  all  other  stems  (including  instrumentals/others)  are  paid,  and  length  for  each  
stem
 
is
 
taken
 
from
 
your
 
account
 
separately
 
for
 
each
 
model.
  No  credit  is  not  required  for  the  trial.   For  free,  only  mp3  output  and  10  minutes  input  limit.  For  paid  users  there's  a  20  minutes  limit,  and  mp3/wav  output,  plus  paid  users  have  faster  
queue,
 
shareable
 
links,
 
and
 
long
 
term
 
results
 
storage.
  Seems  like  there  weren't  any  changes  in  the  model  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGWaoBOkiMg  The  old  files  from  previous  separations  on  your  account  didn't  get  deleted  so  far  if  you  have  
premium.
  https://studio.gaudiolab.io/pricing  There  was  also  added  a  new  option  for  vocals  called  “Vocal  remover”  -  good  "for  
conservative
 
vocals,
 
it's
 
fine
 
it
 
even
 
has
 
15
 
best
 
scoring
 
on
 
SDR."
 
and
 
10.85
 
in
 
vocals
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset.
  Instruction   Log  in,  and  re-enter  into  the  link  above  if  you  feel  lost  on  the  landing  page.   For  instrumental  with  vocals,  simply  uncheck  drums,  choose  vocal,  and  two  stems  will  be  
available
 
for
 
download.
  As  for  using  4/5  stem  option  for  instrumental  after  mixing  if  you  save  the  tracks  mixed  in  24  
bit
 
in
 
DAW
 
like
 
Audacity,
 
it
 
currently
 
produces
 
less
 
voice
 
leftovers,
 
but
 
the
 
instrumental
 
have
 
worse
 
quality
 
and
 
spectrum
 
probably
 
due
 
to
 
noise
 
cancellation
 
(which
 
is
 
a
 
possible
 
cause
 
of
 missing  sounds in  other  stem).  Use  5  stem,  but  cut  silence  in  places  when  there  is  no  guitar  in  the  stem  to  get  comparable  quality  to  4  stem  in  such  places.   For  3-6  stem,  you  better  don’t  use  dedicated  stems  mixing  option  -  yes,  it  respects  muting  
stems
 
to
 
get
 
instrumental
 
as
 
well,
 
but
 
the
 
output
 
is
 
always
 
mp3
 
128kbps
 
while
 
you
 
can
 
perform
 
mixdown
 
from
 
mp3s
 
to
 
even
 
lossless

bit
 
in
 
free
 
DAWs
 
like
 
Audacity
 
or
 
Cakewalk.
