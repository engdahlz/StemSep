     “New  models  are  great!  I'm  having  a  little  issue  on  higher  frequencies  hanging  in  the  vocals,  
but
 
I
 
found
 
I
 
can
 
remove
 
that
 
by
 
processing
 
again”
  "Anyone  else  still  uses  inst  464?  I've  been  testing  it  and  my  conclusion  is  that  it's  a  great  
model
 
alongside
 
418
  the  pros  of  it  are  that  it  sounds  fuller  and  doesn't  have  a  lot  of  vocal  residues,  but  it  falls  short  
when
 
picking
 
up
 
some
 
vocals,
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
occasions
 
where
 
it
 
misses
 
some
 
bits,
 
or
 
you
 
can
 
hear
 
some
 
very
 
low
 
or
 
very
 
high-pitched
 
vocals
 
(though
 
this
 
is
 
mostly
 
fixed
 
by
 
using
 
other
 
models)"
  "I've  only  tested  one  track  so  far,  with  468  (My  usual  first  test;  Rush  -  The  Pass).  First  off,  it's  
the
 
cleanest
 
vocal
 
removal
 
of
 
the
 
track
 
yet.
 
First
 
model
 
to
 
really
 
deal
 
with
 
the
 
reverb/echo
 
and
 
faint
 
residuals
 
...
 
but
 
also
 
the
 
first
 
model
 
to
 
trap
 
a
 
ton
 
of
 
instrumentation
 
in
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem.
 
  Fascinatingly  again,  the  UVR  Karaokee  model  was  able  to  almost  perfectly  remove  the  
trapped
 
instrumentation
 
from
 
the
 
vocal
 
line,
 
creating
 
a
 
much
 
more
 
perfect
 
result.
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
the
 
new
 
models
 
were
 
trained
 
with
 
this
 
in
 
mind,
 
but
 
the
 
Karaokee
 
model
 
has
 
proven
 
to
 
be
 
extremely
 
effective
 
at
 
this.
 
The
 
two
 
almost
 
work
 
as
 
a
 
necessary
 
pair."
 (UVR  Karaoke  model  should  be  available  on  MVSEP  or  maybe  also  x-minus,  and  of  course  
UVR5
 
GUI
 
and
 
it's
 
free
 
and
 
public)
  September  update   of  MDX  vocal  models  added  only  for  premium  users  (more  models  available  in  GUI,  to  be  
redeemed
 
with
 
code).
 
They're
 
available
 
online
 
exclusively
 
for
 
our
 
Discord
 
server
 
via
 
this
 
link:
 https://x-minus.pro/ai?hp&test-mdx (probably  not  needed  or  working  anymore  as  training  is  finished  and  final  models  are  already  
released
 
from
 
this
 
training
 
period,
 
but
 
I'll
 
leave
 
it
 
just
 
in
 
case).
 edit.  Be  aware  that  models  below  are  outdated  and  newer  above  supposed  to  outperform  
already
 
them

  Vocal  models:  -  beta  340  is  better  for  vocals,  while  -  -  390  has  better  quality  for  instrumentals,  though  it  has  more  vocal  residues.  -  "423  is  really  nice  for  extracting  vocals,  but  is  not  good  for  instrumentals  -  427  is  not  good  for  me."
