    -  It  can  consume  free  "credits"  till  you  click  Environment>Terminate  session.  It  happens  even  
if
 
you
 
close
 
the
 
Colab
 
tab.
 
You
 
can
 
check
 
“This
 
is
 
the
 
end”
 
option
 
so
 
the
 
GUI
 
will
 
terminate
 
the
 
session
 
after
 
separation
 
is
 
done
 
to
 
not
 
drain
 
your
 
free
 
limit.
  -  (rather  fixed)  As  for  4.2  version,  session  crashes  for  free  Colab  users  can  occur,  due  to  
running
 
out
 
of
 
memory.
 
You
 
can
 
try
 
out
 
shorter
 
files.
 Currently,  if  you  rename  your  output  folder  with  separation,  and  retry  separation,  it  will  look  
for
 
the
 
old
 
folder
 
with
 
separation
 
to
 
delete,
 
and
 
return
 
the
 
error,
 
and
 
running
 
the
 
GUI
 
cell
 
again
 
may
 
cause
 
disappearing
 
of
 
GUI
 
elements.
 it's  a  default  behavior  of  Colab  and  IPython  core  :  Sync  of  files  the  Colab  sees  is  not  real  
time
 Two  possible  solutions:  -  wait  until  sync  with  Google  Drive  is  done  -  restart  &  run  Colab   -  Sometimes  shutting  down  your  environment  in  Environment  options  and  starting  over  might  
do
 
the
 
trick
 
if
 
something
 
doesn't
 
work.
 
E.g.
 
(if
 
it
 
wasn't
 
fixed),
 
when
 
you
 
manipulate
 
input
 
files
 
on
 
GDrive
 
when
 
GUI
 
is
 
still
 
opened,
 
and
 
you
 
just
 
finished
 
separation,
 
you
 
might
 
run
 
into
 
an
 
error
 
when
 
you
 
start
 
separating
 
another
 
file
 
with
 
input
 
folder
 
content
 
changed.
 
 In  order  to  avoid  it,  you  need  to  run  the  GUI  cell  again  after  you've  changed  the  input  folder  
content
 
(IRC
 
it's
 
"Music"
 
folder
 
by
 
default).
 
Maybe
 
too
 
low
 
chunks
 
(below
 
500k
 
for
 
too
 
long
 
tracks
 
if
 
something
 
hasn't
 
changed
 
in
 
the
 
code).
 
Also,
 
check
 
with
 
some
 
other
 
input
 
file
 
you
 
used
 
before
 
and
 
worked
 
before
 
first.
 Also,  be  more  specific  about  what  doesn't  work.  Provide  screenshot  and/or  paste  the  error.   -  You  can  be  logged  to  a  maximum  of  10  Google  accounts  at  the  same  time.  You  can’t  log  
out
 
of
 
any
 
of
 
these
 
single
 
accounts
 
on
 
PC
 
in
 
browser.
 
The
 
only
 
way
 
is
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
on
 
your
 
Android
 
phone,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
not
 
fix
 
the
 
problem,
 
as
 
it
 
will
 
tell
 
“logged
 
out”
 
on
 
that
 
account
 
on
 
PC,
 
and
 
logging
 
into
 
other
 
one
 
might
 
not
 
work
 
and
 
the
 
limit
 
will
 
be
 
still
 
exceeded.
 
At
 
this
 
situation
 
you
 
can
 
only
 
logged
 
out
 
from
 
all
 
accounts
 
(but
 
it
 
will
 
break
 
accounts
 
order,
 
so
 
any
 
authorizations
 
set
 
to
 
specific
 
accounts
 
in
 
your
 
bookmarked
 
links
 
will
 
be
 
messed
 
up
 
-
 
e.g.
 
those
 
to
 
Colab,
 
GDrive,
 
Gmail,
 
etc.
 
I
 
mean:
 
/u/0
 
and
 
in
 
Colab
 
authuser=
 
in
 
links.
 
Easier
 
way
 
to
 
access
 
to
 
extra
 
Google
 
account
 
will
 
be
 
to
 
log
 
into
 
it
 
from
 
Incognito
 
mode.
 If  you  possess  lots  of  accounts  and  you  don’t  log  for  some  for  2  years,  Google  can  delete  it.  
To
 
avoid
 
it,
 
create
 
YT
 
channel
 
on
 
it,
 
and
 
upload
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
video,
 
and
 
the
 
account
 
won’t
 
be
 
deleted.
