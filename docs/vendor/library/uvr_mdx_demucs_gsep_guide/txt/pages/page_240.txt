  -  MVSep  Synth  (also,  it  can  sometimes  pick  up  bass  in  places  where  regular  model’s  can’t)   4  stems  in  one  model  -  Demucs_ft  (4  stem)  -  the  best  single  Demucs’  model  (Colab /  MVSEP /  UVR5  GUI)  Multisong  dataset  SDR  9.48:  bass:  12.24,  drums:  11.41,  other:  5.84,  vocals:  8.43

Good
 
bass
 
stem
 
as
 
Demucs
 
“considers
 
not
 
only
 
spectrograms
 
but
 
also
 
waveforms”.
 For  4  stems  alternatively  check  MDX_extra,  generally  Demucs  6  stem  model  is  worse  than  MDX-B  (a.k.a.  Leaderbord  B)  4  stem  model  released  with  MDX-Net  arch from  MDX21  competition  (kuielab_b_x.onnx  in  this  Colab),  and  is  also  faster  than  Demucs  6s.   For  Demucs  use  overlap  0.1  if  you  have  instrumental  instead  of  mixture  mixed  with  vocals  as  
input
 
(at
 
least
 
it
 
works
 
with
 
ft
 
model)
 
and
 
shifts
 
10
 
or
 
higher.
 
For
 
normal
 
use
 
case
 
(not
 
instrumentals
 
input)
 
it
 
will
 
give
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
overlap
 
0.75
 
is
 
max
 
reasonable
 
speed-wise,

  -  SCNet-large_starrytong model  (4  stems)  (Colab or  MSST-GUI)  Multisong  dataset  SDR  9.29:  bass:  11.28,  drums:  11.24,  other:  5.58,  vocals:  9.06  (overlap:  4)  It’s  3x  faster  than  Demucs  (Nvidia  GPU  or  CPU-only)  and  sounds  better  for  some  people,  except  for  bass.  SDR-wise,  vocals  are  better  than  in  demucs_ft  (which  is  low  vs  single  vocal/inst  models  anyway).  Better  SDR  than  starrytong’s  MUSDB18  and  Mamba  models.   -  Ableton  12.3  update’s  high  quality  option  separation  (4  stems)  -  slow,  works  only  on  CPU,  
probably
 
utilizes

better

minutes
 
for

minutes

on
 
slower

(iirc

The

has
 
very
 
low
