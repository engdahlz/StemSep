    https://youtu.be/Hheg88LKVDs   Q&A  by  Bas  Curtis  and  jazzpear   Q:  What  is  the  difference  between  running  with  and  without  the  usage  of  reference  query  
audio?
  A:  Query  audio  lets  you  input  audio  for  it  to  reference  and  extract  similar  songs  based  upon  
(like
 
zeroshot
 
but
 
way
 
better)
 
whereas
 
without
 
a
 
query
 
auto
 
splits
 
many
 
stems
 
of
 
all
 
kinds
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
feed
 
it
 
a
 
query.
  Q:  Let's  say  there  is  this  annoying  flute  you  wanna  get  rid  off...  and  keep  the  vocals  only....  You  feed  a  snippet  of  the  flute  as  reference,  so  it  tries  to  ditch  it  from  the  input?   A:  Quite  the  reverse.  It  extracts  the  flute  only  which  ig  you  could  use  to  invert  and  get  rid  of  it  
Zero  Shot  (any  sample;  esp.  instruments)   https://github.com/RetroCirce/Zero_Shot_Audio_Source_Separation (as  USS  Bytedance came  out  now,  zero  shot  can  be  regarded  as  obsolete  now,  although  zero-shot  might  is  rather  better  for  single  instruments  than  for  SFX)   You  provide  e.g.  sample  of  any  trumpet  or  any  other  instrument,  and  AI  returns  it  from  a  
song
 
you
 
choose
 
to
 
separate.
 Guide  and  troubleshooting for  local  installation  (get  Discord  invitation  in  footer  first  if  necessary).  Google  Colab  troubleshooting and  notebook (though  it  may  not  work  at  times  when  GDrive  link  resources  are  out  of  download  limit,  also  it  returns  some  torch  issues  after  Colab  
updates
 
in
 
2023).
 Check  out  also  this  Colab  alternative:  https://replicate.com/retrocirce/zero_shot_audio_source_separation It's  faster  (mono  input  required).    Also  available  on  https://mvsep.com/ in  a  form  of  4  stems  without  custom  queries,  and  it’s  not  better  than  Demucs  in  this  form.   "Zero  shot  isn't  meant  to  be  used  as  a  general  model,  that's  why  it  accelerates  on  a  specific  
class
 
of
 
sounds
 
with
 
some
 
limitations
 
in
 
mind....
 
It
 
mostly
 
works
 
the
 
best
 
when
 
samples
 
match
 
the
 
original
 
input
 
mixture,
 
of
 
course
 
there
 
are
 
limitations"
