    older  1.9.1.0 version  of  the  library.  Restart  UVR  after  replacing  the  file!  If  you  use  an  incompatible  library  version,  you’ll  encounter  the  “Unhandled  exception”  startup  
issue.
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
the
 
linked
 
older
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
library
 
might
 
cause
 
additional
 
noise
 
for
 
MDX-Net
 
v2
 
models
 
like
 
HQ_X
 
(the
 
issue
 
is
 
gone
 
when
 
you
 
turn
 
off
 
GPU
 
Conversion).
  -  All  MDX-Net  v2  models  (maybe  beside  4  stem  variants),  have  so  called  MDX  noise,  which  
can
 
be
 
cancelled
 
by
 
using
 
Options>Advanced
 
MDX-Net
 
Settings>Denoise
 
Output>Standard
 
(or
 
Model)
  
  -  At  least  beta  #2  Roformer  update  caused  some  stability  and  performance  issues  with  other  
archs
 
than
 
Roformers
 
for
 
some
 
people
 
when
 
specific
 
parameters
 
started
 
to
 
take
 
more
 
time
 
than
 
before.
 Roll  back  to  stable  5.6  (non  5.6.1)  in  these  cases  if  necessary.  Possibly  make  a  copy  of  the  
old
 
installation.
 
Your
 
configuration
 
files
 
might
 
be
 
lost.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
both
 
installations
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
(or
 
at
 
least
 
when
 
one,
 
e.g.
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
is
 
installed
 
or
 
symlinked
 
in
 
the
 
default
 
location).
  -  (I  think  I  covered  that  issue  above  more  thoroughly)  Roformer  models  in  at  least  patch  #2  work  only  in  “Multi-Stem”  mode  in  UVR.  Using  them  in  
Ensemble
 
causes
 
layers
 
errors
 
(you
 
can
 
use
 
manual
 
Ensemble
 
instead).
 
Iirc,
 
it’s
 
caused
 
by
 
yaml
 
config
 
where
 
instead
 
of
 
Instrumental
 
+
 
Vocals
 
(with
 
V
 
as
 
capital
 
letter)
 
there’s
 
written
 
other
 
+
 
vocals,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
change
 
it.
 
Iirc
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
happen
 
on
 
models
 
downloaded
 
from
 
Download
 
Center
 
as
 
Anjok
 
was
 
fixing
 
the
 
issue,
 
but
 
the
 
problem
 
might
 
still
 
exist
 
in
 
yamls
 
of
 
some
 
custom
 
models
 
outside
 
the
 
center
 
 -  If  you  have  sudden  issues  with  not  being  able  to  separate,  try  to  reinstall  the  app,  and/or  
possibly
 
make
 
sure
 
you
 
didn’t
 
turn
 
on
 
some
 
power
 
saving
 
option
 
in
 
your
 
laptop.
 
Plus,
 
you
 
can
 
simply
 
try
 
to
 
reopen
 
UVR
 
(few
 
fail
 
tries
 
on
 
incompatible
 
DirectML.dll
 
with
 
your
 
GPU
 
driver/OS
 
will
 
hang
 
UVR
 
on
 
“Loading
 
Model”
 
till
 
you
 
close
 
UVR
 
manually
 
from
 
Task
 
Manager).

-
 
(deprecated
 
since
 
patch
 
#10
 
-
 
now
 
convert
 
dim_t
 
it
 
to
 
chunk_size)
 
dim_t
 
=
 
1101
 
seems
 
to
 be  a  sweet  spot  in  terms  of  speed/SDR  according  to  measurements  (although  on  1  minute  files);  use  1120  if  UVR  refuses  to  accept  1101  in  GUI  (or  edit  yaml  file)   -  (deprecated  since  patch  #10)  Some  Roformer  configs  have  wrong  dim_t  at  the  bottom  of  
the
 
yaml
 
by
 
default
 
(e.g.
 
256),
 
change
 
it
 
at
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
yaml
 
config
 
for
 
better
 
SDR
 
(not
 
the
 
one
 
at
 
the
 
top),
 
e.g.
 
to
 
1101
 
(more
 
explanations
 
on
 
it
 
later).
