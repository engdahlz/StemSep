     On  the  flip  side:  there  are  times  when  they  cancel  each  other  out,  because  the  amplitude  are  
different
 
(e.g
 
1st
 
being
 
+1
 
and
 
the
 
2nd
 
being
 
-1)
  I  watched  a  video  guide  in  Fourier  Transform,  and  the  concept  is  visually  demonstrated  
really
 
well:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&t=50s  In  a  nutshell:  If  you  take  away  the  vocals,  certain  frequencies  of  the  instrumental  get  
amplified,
 
because
 
now
 
the
 
vocal
 
isn't
 
there
 
to
 
dampen
 
it/cancel
 
it
 
out.
  You  can  recreate  this  by  taking  a  brickwall  limited  recording  of  your  choice,  lowering  the  
DBFS
 
by
 
at
 
least
 
-2.
 
Then
 
you
 
can
 
process
 
it
 
through
 
an
 
MDX
 
model,
 
and
 
then
 
compare
 
the
 
peak
 
amplitudes
 
of:
 1.  the  mixture  2.  the  Instrumental  3.  and  the  separated  instrumental  and  acapella  mixed  back  together   https://github.com/jeonchangbin49/musdb-XL/  From  what  I  can  understand,  they  applied  a  maximizer  to  all  the  mixtures,  then  calculated  
the
 
differences
 
of
 
amplitude
 
in
 
a
 
sample
 
by
 
samples
 
by
 
basis,
 
and
 
applied
 
the
 
difference
 
to
 
all
 
the
 
stems
 
at
 
once.
  I  think  I  could  do  that.   Update  “Even  though  I  have  found  out  that  using  Pro-C  2  [Sidechain  compressor,  not  a  limiter]  totally  
fixes
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
mixes
 
clipping
 
after
 
turning
 
down
 
just
 
about
 
any
 
stem,
 
the
 
trade-off
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
LUFS
 
[short
 
term]
 
suffers
 
by
 
at
 
least
 
-2

  (older  techniques  from  before  the  guide  above)   jarredou’s  guide:   Here's  2  "proof-of-concept"  python  dynamic  range  compressor/limiter  I've  made  recently  and  
that
 
are
 
working
 
with
 
sidechain
 
and
 
multiple
 
stems
 
inputs:
  1st  one  "pydub_comp_fork.py"  is  a  fork  of  pydub's  dynamic  range  compressor  (line79  to  change  the  audio  inputs)  You  can  set  attack/release/ratio/threshold  settings  like  any  other  compressor   ---
