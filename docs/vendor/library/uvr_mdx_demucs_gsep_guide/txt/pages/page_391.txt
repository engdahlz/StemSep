    more  neutral  vs  500m_1  with  mirroring  (not  always  an  upside).  It’s  not  available  in  GUI  by  
default
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
not
 
fully
 
satisfactory
 
results
 
vs
 
models
 
above.
  Window  size:  272  Aggressiveness:  0.2  TTA:  ON  Postprocess:  off  mirroring   SP  in  the  GUI  models  stands  for  "Standard  Precision".  Those  models  use  the  least  amount  
of
 
computing
 
resources
 
of
 
any
 
other
 
models
 
in
 
the
 
application.
 
HP
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand
  
stands
 
for
 
"Higher
 
Precision"
 
those
 
models
 
use
 
more
 
resources
 
but
 
have
 
better
 
performance.
  So,  what's  the  best  VR  arch  model?  I'd  stick  to  HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m  (1_HP-UVR)  if  it  only  gives  good  result  for  your  
song
 
(e.g.
 
hip-hop).
 
If
 
you're
 
forced
 
to
 
use
 
any
 
other
 
VR
 
model
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
song
 
due
 
to
 
unsatisfactory
 
results
 
with
 
this
 
model,
 
then
 
probably
 
current
 
MDX
 
models
 
will
 
achieve
 
better
 
results.
 Second  most  usable  model  for  me  was  500_m1(9_HP2),  and  then  
HP-4BAND-V2_arch-124m
 
(2_HP-UVR)
 
or
 
something
 
in
 
between,
 
but
 
compared
 
to
 
MDX-UVR
 
models,
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
worth
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
anymore
 
due
 
to
 
possibility
 
of
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues.

13/14_SP
 
models
 
(called
 
4-band
 
beta
 
1/2
 
in
 
the
 
Colab)
 
-
 
less
 
aggressive
 
than
 
above
 (these  are  older  UVR5  models  by  UVR  team  -  less  aggressive,  give  more  vocal  residues  
frequently’
 
the
 
mid
 
ones
 
have
 
less
 
clarity,
 
but
 
might
 
be
 
less
 
noisy
 
-
 
but
 
they’re
 
surpassed
 
by
 
MDX
 
models)
   -  v4  models  -  Even  older  models  from  times  of  previous  VR  codebase  
"All
 
the
 
old
 
v5
 
beta
 
models
 
that
 
weren't
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
main
 
package
 
are
 
compatible
 
[with
 
UVR]
 
as
 
well.
 
Only
 
thing
 
is,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
append
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
parameter
 
to
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
name"
 Also,  V4  models  are  still  compatible  with  UVR  using  this  method.   “Main  Models   MGM_MAIN_v4_sr44100_hl512_nf2048.pth  -   This  is  the  main  model  that  does  an  excellent  job  removing  vocals  from  most  tracks.  MGM_LOWEND_A_v4_sr32000_hl512_nf2048.pth  -   This  model  focuses  a  bit  more  on  removing  vocals  from  lower  frequencies.  MGM_LOWEND_B_v4_sr33075_hl384_nf2048.pth  -
