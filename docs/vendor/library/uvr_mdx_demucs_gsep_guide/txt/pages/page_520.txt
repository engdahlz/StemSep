UVR  2.20  (it  achieved  some  good  results  for  old  70’s  pop  music  for  me  where  cymbals  got  
muffled
 
on
 
current
 
models,
 
but
 
prepare
 
for
 
more
 
bleeding
 
in

than
 
5
 
stem
 
(and
 
even
 
vs
 
2
 
stem,
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
also
 
reflected
 
in
 
SDR
 
results).
 
Use
 
11kHz
 
models
 
only
 
if
 
your
 
input
 
files
 
are
 
sampled
 
at
 
22kHz
 
(it
 
will
 
provide
 
better
 
result
 
in
 
this
 
and
 
only
 
in
 
this
 
case).
