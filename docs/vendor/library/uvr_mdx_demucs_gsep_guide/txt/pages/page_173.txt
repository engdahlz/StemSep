    Be  aware  that  MVSep’s  BS-Roformer  2025.07  can  be  better  for  metal  both  for  vocal  and  
instrumentals
 
than
 
these
 
mesk’s
 
models,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
times.
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
trained
 
on
 
mesk’s
 
metal
 
dataset.
 -  Custom  model  import  Colab  has  currently  some  issues  with  it.  Probably,  using  that  old  
version
 
will
 
work
 
(at
 
least
 
locally).
 "My  old  MSST  repo  I'm  using,  but  I  removed  all  the  training  stuff  https://drive.proton.me/urls/P530GFQR4W#VCAsF0E1TPje pip  install  -r  requirements.txt  (u  gotta  have  Python  and  PyTorch  installed  as  well)  for  the  
script
 
to
 
work.
 You  just  gotta  put  all  the  tracks  you  want  to  test  on  in  the  **"tracks"**  folder  then  double-click  
on
 
**"inference.bat"**
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
inference
 
script
 its  like  if  you  were  to  type  in  the  command  in  cmd  but  its  simpler,  and  I'm  lazy"  -  mesk   -  Older  Mesk  metal  Mel-Roformer  preview  instrumental  model   Inst.  fullness:  28.81,  bleedless:  42.16,  SDR  16.66

“Slightly
 
better
