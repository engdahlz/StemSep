    Spectral  Inversion:  No    Mateus  Contini's  methods    #1  (old)   -“TIP!  For  busy  songs:  I  was  testing  some  ensembles  trying  to  get  Instrumental  Stems  with  
less
 
volume
 
variation
 
(muddy),
 
preserving
 
guitar
 
solos,
 
pads
 
the
 
most
 
and
 
I
 
had
 
great
 
results
 
doing
 
the
 
following,
 
for
 
anyone
 
interested:
 
 Ensemble  (Demucs  +  5_HP-Karaoke  with  Max  for  Instrumental  stem)  -  The  result  will  be  the  
Instruments
 
+
 
Backing
 
Vocals
 
and
 
this
 
preserves
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
guitar
 
solos,
 
pads
 
and
 
things
 
that
 
MDX
 
struggles.
 Instrumental  Stem  Output  >  Demucs  to  remove  the  Backing  Vocals  from  the  track  -  This  
pass
 
will
 
remove
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
Vocals.
 
In
 
some
 
cases
 
will
 
be
 
some
 
minor
 
leftovers
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
clean
 
later
 
with
 
other
 
methods.
 I  find  the  results  better  than  Demucs  alone/  MDX  models  or  other  ensembles  for  what  I'm  
looking
 
for.
 
I'm
 
not
 
evaluating
 
noise,
 
but
 
fuller
 
instrumental
 
Stems,
 
trying
 
to
 
preserve
 
most
 
of
 
it
 
and
 
also
 
the
 
cost
 
(time)
 
to
 
do
 
it.
 Since  I'm  not  interested,  for  this  case,  in  doing  manual  work  song  by  song  and  just  use  these  
stems
 
to
 
sing
 
over
 
it,
 
I
 
find
 
the
 
results
 
great.”

 Q:  Do  you  mean  that  you  process  Demucs  2  times?  Once  for  ensemble  with  VR  then  the  
result
 
was
 
processed
 
using
 
Demucs
 
again?
 A:  You  can  add  other  models  with  the  ensemble,  like  Demucs,  VR_5-Karaoke  and  HQ3  for  
an
 
extra,
 
before
 
processing
 
again
 
with
 
Demucs.
 Also,  this  method  is  very  good  for  leave  good  backing  vocals  into  the  instrumentals  (only  the  
ensemble
 
result).
 
I
 
find
 
extracting
 
bv
 
from
 
the
 
Vocal
 
Stem
 
to
 
be
 
less
 
effective,
 
giving
 
you
 
less
 
material
 
(comparing
 
if
 
you
 
would
 
join
 
the
 
bv
 
with
 
instrumentals
 
later)
  M.Contini  Method  #2  (newer)   Well,  I  tried  to  improve  the  results  of  the  method  I  posted,  so  here  it  is,  for  **anyone  
interested
 
in
 
get
 
fuller
 
Instrumentals**,
 
with
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
bleed
 
in
 
some
 
songs,
 
wielding
 
great
 
results
 
overall.
  I'm  doing  this  in  the  UVR-gui.  The  idea  behind  it  is  to  scoop  the  vocals  little  by  little,  so  the  
instrumentals
 
is
 
preserved
 
the
 
most.
 
The
 
proccess
 
requires
 
3
 
extractions.
 
Here
 
are
 
the
 
Ensembles:
  1.  pass  Ensemble:  5_HP-Karaoke-UVR  +  Inst  HQ3  +  htdemucs  -  Min/  Max                       -  If  the  song  doesn't  have  BV,  this  will  already  give  you  good  Instrumental  Stem  
results.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
Vocals
 
bleeding
 
into
 
the
 
Instr,
 
continue
 
to
 
pass
 
2,
 
but
 
sometimes
 
jumping
 
straight
 
to
 
pass3
 
will
 
produce
 
better
 
results.
