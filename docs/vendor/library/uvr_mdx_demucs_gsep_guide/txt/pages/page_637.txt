    Video how  to  apply  demudder  method   Notes    -  For  HQ  4  and  at  least  denoise  model  enabled,  the  method  seems  to  produce  more  vocal  
residues,
 
so
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
feasible
 
more
 
for
 
Roformers
 
(it’s
 
used
 
optionally
 
for
 
Kim
 
Mel-Roformer
 
on
 
x-minus).
  -  "xminus  demudder  is  more  pleasing  to  the  ears"  isling   -  Some  people  might  still  prefer  max_mag  ensemble  on  x-minus  or  mel-roformer  +  
bs-roformer
 
ensemble
 
in
 
UVR
  Phase  fixer  on  x-minus  for  unwa  inst  v1  model  copies  phase  from  Kim  Mel-Roformer  model.   UVR  Demudders  released  in  beta  Roformer  patch (in  Anjok’s  words)  ●  Phase  Rotate :  
The
 
fullest
 
sounding,
 
but
 
can
 
leave
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
artifacts
 
with
 
certain
 
models.
 
I
 
only
 
recommend
 
that
 
method
 
for
 
the
 
muddiest
 
models.
 
Otherwise,
 
Combined
 
Methods
 
is
 
the
 
best”
 
 ○  First,  a  filtered  instrumental  is  created,  and  the  left  and  right  channels  
are
 
swapped.
 ○  The  phase  is  shifted  by  90  degrees.  ○  This  modified  filtered  instrumental  is  then  inverted  with  the  original  
mixture,
 
and
 
another
 
inference
 
pass
 
is
 
performed
 
on
 
the
 
resulting
 
mixture.
 ○  Finally,  the  vocal  from  the  second  pass  is  phase-inverted  and  combined  
with
 
the
 
original
 
mixture,
 
creating
 
a
 
cleaner
 
instrumental.
  ●  Phase  Remix  (similar  to  X-Minus):  
I
 
don't
 
recommend
 
using
 
phase
 
remix
 
on
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
v1e
 
model.
 
I
 
recommend
 
combined
 
methods
 
or
 
phase
 
rotate
 
for
 
models
 
producing
 
fuller
 
instrumentals.
 
 ○  The  mixture  is  first  separated  into  stems.  ○  The  phase  of  the  vocal  stem  is  inverted  and  mixed  with  the  filtered  
instrumental
 
to
 
produce
 
a
 
modified
 
"mixture."
 
Another
 
inference
 
pass
 
is
 
performed
 
on
 
this
 
new
 
mixture.
 ○  The  vocal  stem  extracted  from  the  modified  mixture  is  then  reintroduced  
into
 
the
 
original
 
mixture,
 
creating
 
a
 
cleaner
 
instrumental.
