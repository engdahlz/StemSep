    Workarounding  issues  with  Python  3.12:  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/issues/1789 Becruily  karaoke  model  error  fix:  “Those  of  you  on  linux  running  the  current  roformer_add+directml  branch  that  cant  get  
becruily's
 
karaoke
 
model
 
working
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
error:
 
it
 
seems
 
editing
 
line
 
790
 
in
 
separate.py
 
setting
 
the
 
keyword
 
argument
 
strict
 
to
 
False
 
when
 
calling
 
load_state_dict
 
seems
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
karaoke
 
model
 
load
 
and
 
infer
 
properly,
 
so
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
work
 model.load_state_dict(checkpoint,  strict=False)  I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  robust  workaround,  but  I  haven't  observed  anything  behaving  
differently
 
than
 
it
 
should
 
yet,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
give
 
it
 
a
 
shot
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
work
 TL;DR  change  line  790  in  separate.py  to  the  codeblock  and  then  run  again  and  karaoke  
model
 
should
 
work”
