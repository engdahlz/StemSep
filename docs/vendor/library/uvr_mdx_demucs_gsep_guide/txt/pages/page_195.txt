    The  fix:  “SUC-DriverOld/MSST-WebUI  use  the  name  "modules"  and  
ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training
 
use
 
the
 
name
 
"models".
 
And
 
Unwa's
  
bs_roformer.py
 
that
 
you
 
replace
 
with,
 
also
 
use
 
"models".
 
So
 
you'll
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
coding
 
and
 
symlink
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
work.”

up

great!

the

Many  thanks  for  that.”  -  Unwa  “seems  to  sound  better  than  beta5e,  it  sounds  fuller,  but  this  also  means  it  sounds  noisier”  -

it’s

 “very  indecisive  about  whether  to  put  vocal  chops  in  the  vocal  stem  or  instrumental  stem.  sometimes  it  plays  in  vocals  and  fades  out  into  instrumental  stem  and  sometimes  it  just  splits  
it
 
in
 
half

plays
