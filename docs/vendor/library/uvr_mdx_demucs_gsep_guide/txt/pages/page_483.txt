     10)  Cassette  tape  -  wouldn’t  recommend  it  as  a  source  (maybe  unless  it  sounds  superb,  or  
you
 
have
 
a
 
great
 
deck
 
at
 
disposal
 
to
 
rip
 
the
 
recording)
 
-
 
even
 
though
 
the
 
cassette
 
tapes
 
might
 
be
 
still
 
released
 
occasionally,
 
contemporary
 
music
 
usually
 
sound
 
worse
 
on
 
them
 
than
 
it
 
used
 
to
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
and
 
potentially
 
to
 
compensate
 
for
 
it,
 
they
 
might
 
contain
 
different
 
masters
 
(cassette
 
tape
 
won’t
 
invert
 
due
 
to
 
speed
 
fluctuations
 
either)
 11)  Reel  to  reel  tape  (better  quality,  mostly  old  music,  also,  usually  in  the  past,  the  base  
medium
 
for
 
archival
 
original
 
stems
 
of
 
the
 
recording
 
before
 
final
 
mix
 
and
 
master,
 
but
 
degrading
 
along
 
the
 
time,
 
sometimes
 
can
 
change
 
the
 
sound
 
after
 
some
 
time
 
even
 
when
 
in
 
the

of

  General   As  for  good  quality  music  on  streaming  services  you  can  get  FLAC  16  bit  and  24  bit  on  
Qobuz/Amazon)
 
or
 
on
 
Tidal
 
(now
 
also
 
up
 
to
 
24
 
bit
 
FLACs
 
for
 
Master
 
quality
 
-
 
formerly
 
MQA
 
24
 
bit
 
(in
 
the
 
past
 
most
 
of
 
Max
 
(formerly
 
Master)
 
quality
 
on
 
Tidal
 
was
 
16
 
bit
 
MQA,
 
while
 
High
 
(formerly
 
Hi-Fi)
 
is
 
and
 
was
 
always
 
FLAC
 
16
 
bit;
 
MQA
 
was
 
lossy
 
(but
 
less
 
than
 
all
 
other
 
formats),
 
but
 
24
 
bit
 
MQA
 
file
 
could
 
have
 
given
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
16
 
bit
 
FLAC).
 
MQA
 
was
 
gradually
 
transitioned
 
to
 
FLAC
 
on
 
Tidal,
 
but
 
seems
 
like
 
old
 
uploads
 
in
 
24
 
bit
 
MQA
 
are
 
not
 
24
 
bit
 
anymore
 
but
 
just
 
16
 
bit
 
FLACs,
 
so
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
Qobuz
 
to
 
find
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
24
 
bit
 
files
 
if
 
they
 
aren’t
 
available
 
on
 
Tidal
 
like
 
they
 
used
 
to
 
be.
 Most  importantly  -  Feel  free  to  experiment  with  different  versions  and  find  the  best  result  with  a  specific  version  
of
 
your
 
song,
 
although
 
24
 
bit
 
FLAC
 
should
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
(although
 
not
 
everyone
 
might
 
notice
 
the
 
difference).
 
  If  you  have  seemingly  the  same  FLAC  Audio  CD  rip  from  before  streaming  services  times  
(~<2013),
 
it
 
can
 
happen
 
that
 
a
 
lossless
 
file
 
taken
 
from
 
a
 
streaming
 
service
 
may
 
be
 
slightly
 
different
 
in
 
most
 
cases
 
(same
 
length
 
but
 
slight
 
changes
 
in
 
Spek
 
across
 
the
 
whole
 
track
 
which
 
normally
 
don’t
 
exist
 
when
 
comparing
 
FLACs
 
from
 
various
 
streaming
 
services
 
which
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
Audio
 
MD5
 
checksums
 
-
 
also
 
sometimes
 
track
 
finishes
 
in
 
slightly
 
different
 
place).
 
Sometimes
 
it
 
can
 
sound
 
better,
 
sometimes
 
worse
 
 ([ outdated  -  there  are  no  longer  MQA  files  on  Tidal]  and  we’re  talking  about  situation  that  it’s  
not
 
MQA
 
16
 
bit
 
like
 
"Master"
 
quality
 
files
 
on
 
Tidal
 
[but
 
lots
 
are
 
24
 
bit
 
as
 
well,
 
though
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
from
 
e.g.
 
Qobuz
 
if
 
24
 
bit
 
for
 
some
 
track
 
is
 
available,
 
or
 
at
 
least
 
compare
 
both,
 
because
 
it
 
can
 
give
 
slightly
 
different
 
results]).
 
 Also,  it  can  happen  that  24  bit  MQA  on  Tidal  will  sound  better  for  whatever  reason  than  
seemingly
 
better
 
FLAC
 
on
 
Qobuz
 
-
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
possibly
 
due
 
to
 
different
 
files
 
sent
 
to
 
streaming
 
services
 
by
 
the
 
provider/labe.
  How  to  notice  difference  on  spectrogram  in  e.g.  Spek  between  MQA  and  FLAC  is  
frequencies
 
from
 
18kHz
 
(only
 
in
 
certain
 
places)
 
but
 
in
 
all
 
cases
 
-
 
frequencies
 
from
 
21kHz
 
-
 
press
 
alt-tab
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
windows’
 
-
 
don’t
 
hover
 
your
 
mouse
 
between
 
preview
 
of
 
both
