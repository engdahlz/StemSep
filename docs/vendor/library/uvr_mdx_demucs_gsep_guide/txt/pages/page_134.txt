    "VitLarge23"  it's  based  on  new  transformers  arch.  SDR  wise  (9.78  vs  10.17)  it's  not  better  
than
 
MDX23C,
 
but
 
works
 
"great"
 
for
 
ensemble
 
consisting
 
of
 
two
 
models
 
with
 
weights
 
2,
 
1.
  -  MVSEP-MDX23-Colab  fork  v2.2.2  is  out.  It  is  now  using  the  new  InstVocHQ  model  instead  of  D1581:  https://github.com/jarredou/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2/ Memory  issues  with  5:33  songs  fixed  (even  19  minutes  long  with  500K  chunks  supported)   It  should  be  slightly  faster  than  the  previous  version,  as  the  extra  processing  for  the  fullband  
trick
 
is
 
not
 
needed
 
anymore
 
with
 
the
 
new
 
model.
 Q:  Why  is  "overlap_MDX"  set  to  0.0  by  default  in  MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2  ?   A:  because  it's  a  "doublon"  with  MDX  BigShifts  (that  is  better)   -  Stable  final  version  of  UVR  v5.6.0  has  been  released  along  with  MDX23C  fullband  model  
(the
 
same
 
as
 
on
 
MVSEP)
 
-
 
SDR
 
is
 
10.17
 
for
 
vocals
 
&
 
16.48
 
for
 
instrumentals.
 
 It’s  called  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ.  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/  Be  aware  it’s  taking  much  more  time  to  process  a  song  with  it,  then  all  previous  models.  
Also,
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
require
 
volume
 
compensation
 
set.
 
It
 
can
 
leave
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
HQ_3
 
models
 
for
 
some
 
songs.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
it
 
can
 
give
 
very
 
good
 
results
 
with
 
song
 
with
 
“super
 
dense
 
mix
 
like
 
Au5
 
-
 
Snowblind”
 
but
 
also
 
for
 
older
 
tracks
 
like
 
Queen
 
-
 
March
 
Of
 
The
 
Black
 
Queen
 
(always
 
caused
 
issues,
 
but
 
it
 
gave
 
the
 
best
 
result
 
so
 
far,
 
although
 
still
 
lot
 
of
 
BV
 
is
 
missed).
  Performance:  -  3:30  track  with  HQ_3  takes  up  to  24  minutes  on  i3-3217u  while  the  new  model  takes  737  
minutes
 
(precisely
 
1:34
 
vs
 
41:00
 
for
 
15
 
seconds
 
song).
 -  RTX  3060  12  GB  -  takes  around  15  minutes  to  process  a  25  minutes  file  with  the  new  
model.
 
 -  GTX  1080  Ti  took  about  4  minutes  to  process,  about  a  5  min  30  song   -  If  you  upgraded  from  beta,  Matchering  might  not  work  correctly.  In  order  to  fix  the  error:  Go  to  the  Align  tool.  Select  another  option  under  "Volume  Adjustment",  it  can  be  anything.  Now,  matchering  should  work.  The  fix  may  not  apply  for  Linux  installations.   -  KaraFan  original Colab  seems  to  work  now  (v.  3.1)  but  one  track  with  default  settings  takes  30  minutes  for  3:37  track  on  free  T4  (the  last  files  processed  are  called  Final)  and  it  can  get  
you
 
disconnected
 
from
 
runtime
 
quick
 
(especially
 
if
 
you
 
miss
 
some
 
multiple
 
captcha
 
prompts).
 
V.
 
3.1
 
can
 
have
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
in
 
1.x
 
version
 
and
 
even
 
more
 
than
 
in
 
HQ_3
 
model
 
on
 
its
 
own.
 You  might  want  to  consider  using  older  versions  of  KF  with  Kubinka Colab.  -  Now  3.2  version  was  released  with  less  vocal  residues.
