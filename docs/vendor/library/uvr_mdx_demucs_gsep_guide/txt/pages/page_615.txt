    Decided  to  help  you  all  out  and  created  two  REAPER  templates  where  this  mixing  method  is  
used,
 
so
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
manually.
 
I'll
 
give
 
out
 
a
 
4
 
stem
 
template
  
and
 
a
 
2
 
stem
 
template
 
for
 
vocals,
 
and
 
instrumental
 
that
 
you
 
all
 
can
 
use
 
to
 
recreate
 
the
 
above.
  The  steps  to  make  the  above  happen  aren't  exactly  the  same  as  in  the  video,  in  addition  
there
 
are
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
things
 
you
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
(since
 
I
 
have
 
already
 
done
 
it),
 
so
 
here
 
is
 
a
 
step-by-step
 
guide:
  Requirements:  1.  REAPER  (DAW)  [in  the  video,  it  says  you  can  use  any  DAW]  2.  FabFilter  Pro-L  2  limiter  plugin  (preferably  the  regular  VST  version,  instead  of  VST3)   Steps:  1.  Open  the  REAPER  Project  File  of  your  choice  (if  you're  exporting  2  stems,  use  the  2  stem  
version,
 
if
 
you're
 
exporting
 
4
 
stems,
 
use
 
the
 
4
 
stem
 
template)
 2.  Drag  your  stems  into  the  corresponding  channels,  you  also  have  to  drag  it  into  the  
channels
 
labeled:
 
__"DUPE"__
 -Your  vocal  stem  to  "VOCALS",  and  "VOCALS  DUPE"  -Your  drum  stem  to  "DRUMS,  and  "DRUMS  DUPE"  -Your  other  stem  to  "OTHER",  and  "OTHER  DUPE"  -Your  bass  stem  to  "BASS",  and  "BASS  DUPE"  -Your  instrumental  to  "INSTRUMENTAL",  and  "INSTRUMENTAL  DUPE"  [For  the  2  stem  
template]
 3.  Check  the  settings  of  the  limiter  to  make  sure  it  suits  your  needs.  -You  can  set  the  gain  on  the  left  side  of  the  UI,  if  you  think  your  mix  it  still  isn't  loud  enough.  -I  used  8x  oversampling  as  default,  if  you  feel  like  your  CPU  can  handle  more  or  less,  you  
can
 
adjust
 
it
 
to
 
suit
 
your
 
needs.
 -If  the  exported  stems  have  distortion  (by  any  chance),  you  can  set  the  limiting  mode  to  
SAFE,
 
which
 
prioritizes
 
transients,
 
and
 
keeps
 
unwanted
 
sounds
 
to
 
ABSOLUTE
 
ZERO.
 -You  can  also  think  about  adjusting  the  attack,  release,  and  channel  linking  settings  if  it's  not  
good
 
enough,
 
but
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
settings
 
in
 
the
 
templates
 
are
 
good
 
for
 
any
 
form
 
of
 
limiting.
 -Make  sure  "True  Peak  Limiting"  is  always  on,  if  it  isn't,  distortion  might  become  a  factor  
again
 
in
 
the
 
final
 
results
 4.  Now  it's  time  to  export  the  stems  in  the  first  track  folder  individually.  You  can  do  this  by  
soloing
 
them
 
with
 
the
 
yellow
 
"S"
 
button
 
next
 
to
 
the
 
tracks.
  4.5  In  REAPER:  File>Render...  and  render.  Rinse  and  repeat  for  all  of  the  stems.  These  are  the  settings  I  recommend  using,  if  you  plan  to  further  edit  the  results,  and  also  for  
retaining
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
sources:
 -No  Tail  -44100hz  or  48000hz  sample  rate  -Channels:  Stereo  -Resample  mode:  r8brain  free  (highest  quality,  fast)  -Format:  WAV
