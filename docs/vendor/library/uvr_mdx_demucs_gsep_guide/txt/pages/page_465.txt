    "You  don’t  have  to  train  any  fancy  models  to  get  decent  results  [...]  And  it’s  good  at  not  
destroying
 
music".
 
But
 
it
 
usually
 
lefts
 
some
 
vocal
 
bleeding,
 
so
 
process
 
the
 
result
 
using
 
MDX
 
to
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
these
 
low
 
volume
 
vocals.
 
Zero-shot
 
is
 
also
 
capable
 
of
 
removing
 
crowd
 
from
 
recordings
 
pretty
 
well.
  As  for  drums  separation,  like  for  snares,  it’s  not  so  good  as  drumsep/FactorSynth/RipX,  and  
it
 
has
 
cutoff.
  "I  did  zero  shot  tests  a  week  or  two  ago,  and  it  was  killing  it,  pulling  harmonica  down  to  
-40dB,
 
synth
 
lines
 
gone,
 
guitars,
 
anything.
 
And
 
the
 
input
 
sources
 
were
 
literally
 
a
 
few
 
seconds
 
of
 
audio.
 I've  been  pulling  out  whole  synths  and  whistles  and  all  sorts.  Knocks  the  wind  model  into  the  wind,  zero  shot  with  the  right  sample  to  form  the  model  
backbone
 
works
 
really
 
well
  The  key  is  to  give  it  about  10  seconds  of  a  sample  with  a  lot  of  variation,  full  scales,  that  
kinda
 
thing"
