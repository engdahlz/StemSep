[page 283/642]
     Be  aware  that  increasing  only  overlap  to  e.g.  0.5  from  default  0.25,  when  segments  are  still  
at
 
default
 
256
 
will
 
muddy
 
the
 
result
 
a
 
bit
 
(might
 
be
 
more
 
noticeable
 
with
 
denoise
 
model
 
enabled),
 
while
 
increasing
 
segments
 
(at
 
least
 
up
 
to
 
480/512)
 
suppose
 
to
 
add
 
more
 
clarity.
  At  least  on  the  second  beta  Roformer  patch,  max  supported  segment  size  on  4GB  AMD/Intel  
GPUs
 
is
 
480
 
(at
 
least
 
for
 
4:58
 
and
 
HQ
 
1-3
 
can
 
sometimes
 
only
 
work
 
with
 
lower
 
448
 
-
 
higher
 
overlap
 
and
 
segment
 
size
 
crashes).
 
 256/0.5  also  works,  at  least  with  HQ  4  (but  crashes  with  480  segments)  480/0.38  works  too,  but  you  can  settle  on  e.g.  0.31  if  it’s  too  muddy.  Try  not  to  keep  too  many  opened  apps  during  separation,  as  drawing  their  interface  also  
eats
 
up
 
VRAM
 
on
 
the
 
GPU.
   MDX-Net  v2  max  balanced  settings:   Segment  Size:  2752  (1024  if  it’s  taking  too  long  as  it’s  the  last  value  before  processing  time  
increases
 
really
 
much;
 
at
 
least
 
SDR-wise,
 
512
 
is
 
better
 
in
 
every
 
case
 
than
 
default
 
256
 
unless
 
overlap
 
is
 
increased,
 
and
 
still
 
gets
 
good
 
SDR
 
results)
 Overlap:  0.7-/0.8   Denoising   Denoise  option  used  to  increase  SDR  for  MDX-Net  v2,  but  instrumentals  get  a  bit  muddier  (result).  Denoise  model  has  slightly  lower  SDR  (result).  For  MDX23C  models  it  somehow  changed  and  using  standard  denoiser  doesn’t  change  
SDR.
  Spectral  Inversion    On  bigger  dataset  like  Multisong  Leaderboard  decreases  SDR,  but  sometimes  you  can  avoid  
some
 
e.g.
 
instrumental
 
residues
 
using
 
it
 
-
 
can
 
be
 
helpful
 
when
 
you
 
hear
 
instruments
 
in
 
silent
 
parts
 
of
 
vocals.
  Explanation:  "When  you  turn  on  spectral  inversion,  the  SDR  algorithm  is  forced  to  invert  the  spectrum  of  
the
 
signal.
 
This
 
can
 
cause
 
the
 
SDR
 
to
 
lose
 
signal
 
strength,
 
because
 
the
 
inverse
 
of
 
a
 
spectrum
 
is
 
not
 
always
 
a
 
valid
 
signal.
 
The
 
amount
 
of
 
signal
 
loss
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
signal
 
and
 
the
 
algorithm
 
used
 
for
 
spectral
 
inversion.
  In  some  cases,  spectral  inversion  can  actually  improve  the  signal  strength  of  the  SDR.  This  
is
 
because
 
the
 
inverse
 
of
 
a
 
spectrum
 
can
 
sometimes
 
be
 
a
 
more
 
accurate
 
representation
 
of
 
the
 
original
 
signal
 
than
 
the
 
original
 
signal
 
itself.
 
However,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
always
 
the
 
case,
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
experiment
 
with
 
different
 
settings
 
to
 
find
 
the
 
best
 
results.
