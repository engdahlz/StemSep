  DnR   Divide  and  Remaster  v3:  Multilingual  Validation  &  Test  Set  https://zenodo.org/records/12658755 “but  there  are  a  bunch  of  other  versions  of  v3  for  specific  languages,  I'm  not  sure  what  is  the  
difference.
 There  are  separate  versions  for  English,  Spanish,  French,  etc.  https://zenodo.org/communities/opencass/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest=”  In  fact,  you  can  train  on  validation  too,  but  it’s  not  necessary  anymore  as  the  dataset  was  
published
 
already:

certain

on

 You  can  navigate  to  any  tab  page  and  look  for  the  header:  "Isolated  TRACKS  (mp3)"  and  
find
 
the
 
textbox
 
below
 
where
 
it
 
says:
 "Please  sign  up  on  Patreon,  or  if  you  are  already  a  member,  please  login."  The  last  word  links  to  a  Patreon  signup  page,  and  if  you  sign  in,  it  does  not  check  if  you  are  
subscribed
 
to
 
his

not,
 
it
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
access
 
regardless.
  Boom!  Now  you  have  access  to  250+  Lead  and  rhythm  guitar  pairs.  There  is  a  goldmine  
worth
 
of
 
metal
 
stuff
 
in
 
there
 
too.
  This  is  probably  the  closes  we  could  ever  get  to  having  a  contemporary  rhythm/lead  guitar  
dataset
 
that
 
is
 
both
 
relatively
 
large,
 
the
 
rhythm
 
and
 
lead
 
has
 
their
 
own
 
tracks,
 
its
 
diverse,
 
and
 
actually
 
includes
 
songs
 
that
 
we
 
like/listen
 
to.
