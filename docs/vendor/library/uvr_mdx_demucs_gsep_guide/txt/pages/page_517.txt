[page 517/642]
     (fixed  in  UVR  5.6)  Be  aware  that  a  bug  in  manual  ensemble  exist  which  forces  16  bit  
output
 
despite
 
choosing
 
e.g.
 
32-bit
 
float.
 
To
 
fix
 
it,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
execute
 
regular
 
separation
 
of
 
a
 
song
 
with
 
any
 
AI
 
model
 
with
 
32
 
bit
 
set,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
return
 
to
 
manual
 
ensemble
 
without
 
changing
 
any
 
settings
 
now,
 
so
 
from
 
now
 
on
 
it
 
will
 
retain
 
32-bit
 
float
 
in
 
manual
 
ensemble.
 You  can  fix  this  by  changing  the  510th  line  of  lib_v5/spec_utils.py  to:      sf.write(save_path,  normalize(output.T,  is_normalization),  samplerate,  
subtype='FLOAT')
  then  restart  the  program  (yo  may  not  find  that  file  if  your  UVR  is  not  taken  from  
source).
  TBH,  I  didn’t  compare  directly  the  first  EQ  vs  the  latter  Max  Spec  method,  but  the  
latter
 
sounds
 
brighter
 
for
 
sure
 
than
 
opus,
 
and
 
m4a.
 “while  it  helps  to  make  trebles  more  defined,  it's  a  bit  flawed,  due  ensembling  3  
different
 
compression
 
methods,
 
so
 
3
 
different
 
compression
 
flaws/errors
 
and
 
noises”.
  PS.  For  YT  I  also  tried  downsampling  Opus  to  44  and  to  leave  M4A  intact,  but  it  gave  
worse
 
results
 
(probably
 
because
 
of
 
more
 
frequencies
 
affected
 
by
 
resampler
 
in
 
this
 
case).
  Explanation  Audio  file  sizes  and  bitrate  are  the  same  for  both  formats.  Knowing  that  the  cutoff  in  
AAC
 
is
 
not
 
artificial,
 
but
 
codec
 
without
 
a
 
doubt
 
efficiently
 
compresses
 
only
 
audio
 
up
 
to
 
16kHz,
 
leaving
 
everything
 
higher
 
blank
 
and
 
untouched,
 
we
 
can
 
come
 
to
 
the
 
conclusion
 
that
 
frequencies
 
up
 
to
 
16kHz
 
in
 
AAC
 
may
 
sound
 
better
 
than
 
in
 
Opus,
 
since
 
the
 
size
 
and
 
bitrate
 
of
 
both
 
files
 
is
 
the
 
same,
 
and
 
most
 
likely
 
bitrate
 
in
 
AAC
 
is
 
not
 
used
 
to
 
frequencies
 
above
 
16kHz,
 
so
 
full
 
128kbps
 
bitrate
 
is
 
used
 
only
 
for
 
frequencies
 
up
 
to
 
16kHz
 
in
 
AAC
 
codec
 
while
 
in
 
Opus
 
for
 
the
 
whole
 
spectrum
 
up
 
to
 
20
 
or
 
even
 
24kHz
 
in
 
some
 
old
 
videos
 
till
 
around
 
2020,
 
while
 
keeping
 
the
 
same
 
size,
 
so
 
that
 
might
 
be
 
more
 
harmful
 
for
 
frequencies
 
up
 
to
 
16kHz
 
than
 
in
 
AAC.
 
  PS.  After  some  time,  I  receive  explanation/reassurance  on  the  purpose  of  this  process  here,  saying  it’s  generally  justified  and  Opus  is  actually  better  than  AAC  even  above  9600Hz,  so  one  more  additional  cutoff  in  AAC  will  be  needed.  Also,  
might
 
be
 
worthy
 
to
 
use
 
phase
 
linear
 
EQ
 
to
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
some
 
coloration
 
of
 
the
 
result
 
file.
 Experimenting  with  it,  make  sure  that  you  don’t  run  into  overlapping  frequencies  in  area  of  bypassing  (e.g.  you  can  see  it  here as  slightly  brighter  area  above  9.6kHz  up  to  12kHz)  to  avoid  it  in  e.g.  in  RX  editor,  one  filtered  signal  needs  to  be  10Hz  away  
from
 
another
 
one.
 
I.e.
 
if
 
lowpass
 
is
 
12000
 
Hz,
 
then
 
highpass
 
is
 
12010
 
Hz.
 
“But
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
catch
 
with
 
iZotope
 
RX.
 
The
 
10Hz
 
away
 
I
 
described
 
is
 
only
 
applied
 
to
 
the
 
Copy
 
operation
 
(when
 
you
 
basically
 
select
 
the
 
frequency
 
range,
 
and
 
just
 
CTRL+C
 
by
 
copying
 
it).
 
But
 
there
 
is
 
also
 
Silence
 
operation
 
(when
 
you
 
select
 
freq.
 
range
 
and
 
press
 
Delete,
 
it
 
eliminates
 
the
 
freq.
 
in
 
this
 
range),
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
another
 
way
 
around:
