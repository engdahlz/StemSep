    -  Mac  Intel  (x86_64)  users  - Link  -  mesk  wrote  a  good  comprehensive  training  guide for  beginning  model  trainers.  Later  you  can  proceed  to  read  further  section of  this  doc  for  more  details  and  arch  explanations   -  Apple  Music  bot  link  added  in  this section  (thx  mesk)   -  mrmason347  and  Havoc  shared  an  interesting  method  to  get  cleaner  vocals.  The  last  point  of  tips  to  enhance  separation  here:  Separate  with  becruily  Mel  Vocal  model  and  its  instrumental  model  variant,  then  get  vocals  
from
 
the
 
vocal
 
model,
 
and
 
instrumental
 
from
 
instrumental
 
model,
 
import
 
both
 
stems
 
for
 
the
 
DAW
 
of
 
your
 
choice
 
(can
 
be
 
Audacity)
 
so
 
you’ll
 
get
 
a
 
file
 
sounding
 
like
 
original
 
file,
 
then
 
export
 
-
 
perform
 
a
 
mixdown
 
of
 
both
 
stems,
 
then
 
separate
 
it
 
with
 
vocal
 
model
 
 
 
-
 
If
 
you
 
somehow
 
still
 
struggle
 
with
 
“norn”
 
issues

 here  -  Dango  released  “Reverb  Remover”  -  click  “it's  very  similar  to  RX11  Dialogue  Isolate,  good/real-time  set  to  5  it's  like  listening  to  the  same  inference  files”  John;  probably  also  works  in  mono,  you  can  get

  -  filegarden added  to  the  list  of  cloud  services (seems  to  be  unlimited,  registration  required,  link  shortener  with  custom  name  available)   -  your-good-results and  your-bad-results channels  have  been  reopened  on  the  server,  but  you  need  to  paste  links  to  uploads  instead  of  uploading  audio  files  directly  on  Discord  due  to

  -  If  you  want  to  use  Phase  fixer  Colab  with  cut-offs  suggested  by  CC  Karaoke,  check  here  -  Unwa’s  Kim  FT2  model  added  to  the  inference  Colab  (both  inst  and  voc  becruily  models  are  added  too)   -  jarredou  released  Custom  Model  Import Version  of  the  inference  Colab.  You  can  use  it  if  we  don’t  add  any  new  model  to  the  main  Colab  on  time,  or  you  test  your  own  models.  
 
Just
 
make
 
sure
 
that

haven’t
 
“downloaded
 
the
 
webpage
 
presenting
 
the
 
model
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
itself.”
 So,  e.g.  for  yamls  pasted  from  GH,  use:

config_vocals_mdx23c.yaml'
 Instead  of:
