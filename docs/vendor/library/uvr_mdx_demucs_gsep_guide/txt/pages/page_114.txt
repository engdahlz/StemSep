     -  (fixed  in  patch  #10)  VIP  code  in  Roformer  beta  patch  #2-9  (and  probably  #1)  doesn’t  work  -   Download  all  the  VIP  models  you  need  before  patching  older  5.6  to  beta  Roformer  or  use  
two
 
installations
 
of
 
the
 
UVR
 
if
 
you
 
can’t
 
use
 
patch
 
#10
 
with
 
the
 
fix.
  -  (fixed  in  patch  #6)  People  experience  All  stems  error  with  viperx’  12xx  models  in  newer  
versions
 
of
 
UVR
 
Beta
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
(patch
 
#2
 
was
 
the
 
last
 
confirmed
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
these
 
older
 
models)
  -  (fixed  in  patch  #10)  mlp_expansion_factor:  1  or  (when  mlp  line  is  deleted  from  yaml)  
mismatch
 
for
 
MelBand
 
Roformer
 
error
 
 
You
 
probably
 
use
 
older
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
incompatible
 
with
 
newer
 
models
 
(e.g.
 
#2)
 It  also  appears  when  you  wrongly  set  v2  model  type.  
  
Fixed
 
in
 
the
 
beta
 
patch
 
#3
 
and
 
#4
 
for
 
all
 
platforms
  -  Don't  set  overlap  higher  than  11  for  1101  dim_t  ( at  the  bottom  of  yaml  file  in  the  
“inference”
 
section,
 
not
 
above)
 
and
 
overlap
 
8
 
for
 
801
 
-
 
these
 
two
 
are
 
the
 
fastest
 
settings
 
before
 
stem
 
misalignment
 
issues
 
occur.
 
Otherwise,
 
it
 
can
 
lead
 
occasionally
 
to
 
some
 
effects
 
or
 
synths
 
missing
 
from
 
the
 
instrumental
 
stem
 
(although
 
some
 
rules
 
can
 
be
 
broken
 
here
 
with
 
various
 
settings).
 
Also,
 
the
 
problems
 
with
 
clicks
 
are
 
alleviated
 
with
 
these
 
good
 
settings.
  -  In  beta  #2  patch,  best  measured  SDR  for  both  Mel  and  BS-Roformers  is  when  dim_t  =  
1101
 
in
 
the
 
inference
 
section
 
of
 
yaml
 
config
 
and
 
when
 
overlap
 
is
 
set
 
to
 
2
 
in
 
GUI
 
(although
 
1
 
wasn’t
 
tested,
 
and
 
is
 
actually
 
lower).
 
But
 
the
 
last
 
beta
 
patches,
 
all
 
bigger
 
overlap
 
values
 
are
 
slower,
 
so
 
SDR
 
might
 
be
 
higher
 
with
 
higher
 
values.
 Be  aware  that  it  will  increase  separation  time.  Maximum  allowed  value  before  error  is  1801,  
but
 
1501
 
or
 
1601
 
depending
 
on
 
a
 
model
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
max
 
reasonable
 
for
 
experiments
 
before
 
some
 
unwanted
 
downsides
 
of
 
too
 
high
 
or
 
too
 
low
 
dim_t
 
appear
 
(disappearing
 
of
 
some
 
stem
 
elements).
 
In
 
some
 
specific
 
cases,
 
1333
 
(or
 
potentially
 
1301)
 
was
 
giving
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
1101
 
or
 
1501,
 
but
 
it
 
depended
 
on
 
song
 
length
 
-
 
usually
 
it
 
happened
 
on
 
short
 
fragments.
  -  Instruction  for  overlap  and  dim_t  above  applies  to  other  Roformer  models  as  well,  and  not  
only
 
those
