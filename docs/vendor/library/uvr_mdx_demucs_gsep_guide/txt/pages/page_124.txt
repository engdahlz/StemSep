    Downgrading  CUDA  to  11.8  version  fixes  the  issue  too,  but  it  takes  9  minutes  in  order  to  
install
 
that
 
dependency,
 
so
 
it’s
 
faster
 
to
 
use
 
fallback
 
runtime
 
till
 
it’s
 
still
 
available.
 
After
 
that
 
period,
 
just
 
execute
 
this
 
line
 
after
 
initialisation
 
cell:
 console('apt-get  install  cuda-11-8')  and  GPU  acceleration  will  start  to  work  as  usual.  >“Better  fix  [than  CUDA  11.8]   until  final  version  is  released,  using  that  onnxruntime-gpu  
nightly
 
build
 
for
 
cuda12:
 !python  -m  pip  install  ort-nightly-gpu  
--index-url=https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/ort-cuda-12-nig
 htly/pypi/simple/   (no  need  to  install  cuda  11.8)”  jarredou  In  case  of  credential  issues  you  can  try  out  this  package  instead:   !python  -m  pip  -q  install  onnxruntime-gpu  --extra-index-url

   -  LarsNet  model  was  added  on  MVSep.  It's  used  to  separate  drums  tracks  into  5  stems:  kick,  snare,  cymbals,  toms,  hihat.  Source:  https://github.com/polimi-ispl/larsnet It’s  worse  than  Drumsep  as  it  uses  Spleeter-like  architecture,  but  “at  least  they  have  an  extra  output,  so  they  separate  hihats  and  cymbals.”.  Colab “Baseline  models  don't  seem  better  quality  than  drumsep,  but  the  provided  checkpoints  are  
trained
 
with
 
oly
 
22
 
epochs,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
seem
 
much.
 
(and
 
STEMGMD
 
dataset
 
was
 
limited
 
by
 
the
 
only
 
10
 
drumkits),
 
so
 
it
 
could
 
probably
 
be
 
better
 
with
 
better
 
dataset
 
&
 
training”
 “  it  separates  the  toms  so  much  better  [than  Drumsep]”   Similar  situation  as  with  Drumsep  -  you  should  provide  drums  separated  from  e.g.  Demucs  
model.
  -  Captain  FLAM  from  KaraFan asks  for  some  help  due  to  some  recent  repercussions.  You  can  support  him  on  https://ko-fi.com/captain_flam  -  To  preserve  instruments  which  are  counted  as  vocals  by  other  MDXv2  models  in  KaraFan,  use  these preset  5  modified  settings  (dca100fb8).  -  Added  more  remarks  from  testing  these  settings  against  sax  preset  and  others.    -  drumsep  added  on  MVSEP!  (separation  of  drums  from  e.g.  Demucs  4  stem  or  “Ensemble  8  models”/+)   -  New  Bandid  Plus  model  added  on  MVSEP  “I  trained  BandIt  for  vocals.  But  it's  too  far  away  from  MDX23C”  -ZFTurbo  “I  loved  this  bandit  plus  model!!  It  has  great  potential.”
