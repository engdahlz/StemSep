    “(...)  also  a  vocal/inst  separator.  Dry  vocals  go  in  vocal  stem,  everything  else  goes  to  reverb.  
Don't
 
think
 
anvuew's
 
models
 
do
 
that.
 I  might  still  preprocess  with  vocal  isolation  before  dereverb.  But  only  really  worth  it  if  you're  
after
 
high
 
fullness
 
vocals.”

  -  Issues  with  https://huggingface.co/spaces/TheStinger/UVR5_UI occur.  “We  have  a  problem  with  Zero  GPU  atm,  waiting  for  a  fix  from  HF  staff  isn't  related  to  the  code  or  last  commit”  -  Not  Eddy  Meanwhile,  you  can  use:  https://huggingface.co/spaces/qtzmusic/UVR5_UI  -  (MVSEP)  Now  32-bit  float  for  WAV  will  be  used  only  if  gain  level  falls  outside  1.0  range  to  
prevent
 
clipping,
 
otherwise
 
16
 
bit
 
PCM
 
will
 
be
 
used,
 
when
 
it
 
won't
 
occur.

 If  you  have  troubles  with  nulling  due  to  the  new  changes  in  free  version,  consider  decreasing  
volume
 
of
 
your
 
mixtures
 
by
 
e.g.
 
3-5dB,
 
and
 
you
 
won’t
 
be
 
affected,
 
although
 
it
 
might
 
slightly
 
affect
 
separation
 
results.
 Also,  FLAC  now  uses  16-bit  instead  of  24-bit.   -  (MVSEP)  “Sometimes  we  have  complaints  on  speed  from  different  parts  of  the  world.  The  
best
 
way
 
is
 
to
 
use
 
VPN
 
to
 
solve
 
them.”

  -  If  you  feel  overwhelmed  by  this  GDoc’s  list,  isling  released  their  own,  shorter  version  with  recommended  models  for  audio  separation  -  click.   -  Also,  here you’ll  find  an  excerpt  of  the  current  document  with  only  models  and  their  links,  if  you  find  it  hard  to  navigate  through  the  whole  document  (edit.  24.07.25)   -  (MVSEP)  BS-Roformer  2025.06  described  previously  below  received  two  updates  (11.81  ->  
11.86
 
and
 
11.86>11.89)
 
and
 
it
 
has
 
been
 
changed
 
to:
 
 BS-Roformer  2025.07.  Full  metrics.  “All  Ensembles  and  models  where  this  model  is  involved  improved  a  little  bit  too.”  -  ZFTurbo  MVSEP  Multichannel  BS  feature  started  using  11.81  model  at  some  point,  now  sure  if  now  
uses
 
11.89.
 If  you  tried  achieving  results  any  similar  to  BS-Roformer  2025.07,  you  could  potentially  try  out  splifft or  its  Colab.  If  you  fail  to  use  Spliff  check  the  model before  conversion  on  MSST  repo  (more)   -  (MVSEP)  Gabox  INSTV7  instrumental  model  added
