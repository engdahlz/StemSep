    As  for  Karaoke models,  there's  e.g.  a  Mel-Roformer  model  on  x-minus.pro  for  premium  users  or  MVSEP/jarredeou  inference  Colab.  "If  the  vocals  don't  contain  harmonies,  this  model  (Mel)  is  better.  In  other  cases,  it  is  better  to  
use
 
the
 
MDX+UVR
 
Chain
 
ensemble
 
for
 
now.".
 
It
 
is
 
possible
 
to
 
recreate
 
to
 
some
 
extent
 
this
 
approach
 
while
 
not
 
using
 
BVE
 
v2
 
models,
 
by
 
processing
 
the
 
output
 
of
 
main
 
vocal
 
model
 
by
 
one
 
of
 
Karaoke/BVE
 
models
 
in
 
UVR
 
(possibly
 
VR
 
model
 
as
 
the
 
latter)
 
using
 
Settings>Additional
 
Settings>Vocal
 
Splitter
 
Options,
 
so
 
it
 
separates
 
using
 
one
 
model,
 
then
 
it
 
uses
 
the
 
result
 
as
 
input
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
model
 
(see
 
the
 
Karaoke
 
section).
 MedleyVox  (not  available  in  UVR)  will  be  useful  in  the  end  in  cases  when  everything  else  
fails
 
after
 
you
 
obtain
 
all
 
vocals
 
in
 
one
 
stem,
 
as
 
it's
 
very
 
narrowband.
 
But
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
AudioSR
 
on
 
it
 
afterwards.
    >Keeping  only  lead  vocals   in  a  song   Sometimes  the  same  model  might  work  for  lead,  sometimes  for  back  vocals  depending  on  a  song   -  (x-minus/uvronline)  Lead  and  Backing  vocal  separator  (in  “Extract  Backing  
vocals>Mel-Roformer
 
Lead/Back)
 It  uses  big  beta  5e  model  as  preprocessor  for  becruily  Mel  Karaoke  model    “In  fact,  the  big  beta  5e  model  is  run  after  becruily  Mel  Karaoke”  Aufr33  (so  you  don’t  need  
the
 
additional
 
step
 
to
 
use
 
this
 
separator),
 
plus
 
it
 
also
 
allows
 
controlling
 
option
 
for
 
lead
 
vocal
 
panning
 
like
 
for
 
BVE
 
v2
 
(It’s
 
to
 
“to
 
"tell"
 
the
 
AI
 
  where
 
the
 
main
 
vocals
 
are
 
located
 
(how
 
they
 
are
 
mixed).”.
 
“Doesn't
 
even
 
need
 
Lead
 
vocal
 
panning
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
the
 
time,
 
[the]
 
ability
 
to
 
recognize
 
what
 
is
 
LV
 
and
 
what
 
is
 
BV
 
[is]
 
impressive”
 
-
 
dca).
 “The  new  separator  is  available  in  the  free  version,  however,  due  to  its  resource  intensity,  
only
 
the
 
first
 
minute
 
of
 
the
 
song
 
will
 
be
 
processed.”
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
a
 
premium.
 The  difference  from  using  single  becruily  Kar  model  is  that,  here,  “you  get  the  third  track,  
backing
 
vocals.”.
  -  Mel-Roformer  Karaoke  by  becruily  model  file |  Colab |  MVSEP  |  x-minus  “It's  a  dual  model,  trained  for  both  vocals  and  instrumental.  It  sounds  fuller  +  understands  
better
 
what
 
is
 
lead
 
and
 
background
 
vocal
 -  Gabox  Mel  KaraokeGabox model  (uses  Aufr’s  config)  |  Colab “The  lead  vocals  are  good  and  clean!   
While
 
the
 
backing
 
tracks
 
are
 
lossy
 
for
 
this
 
model,
 
[it
 
still]
 
provide[s]
 
great
 
convenient
 
for
 
those
 
who
 
need
 
LdV”
 “The  model  doesn't  keep  the  backing  vocals  below  the  main  vocals,  sometimes  the  backing  
vocals
 
will
 
be
 
lost
 
even
 
though
 
there
 
are
 
backing
 
vocals
 
there.”
 -  Newer  Gabox  experimental  Karaoke  model (June  2025).  It’s  one  stem  target  so  keep  extract_instrumental  enabled  for  the  rest  stem.
