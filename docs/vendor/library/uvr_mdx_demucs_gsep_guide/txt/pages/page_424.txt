    As  for  tracks  with  more  complicated  drums  sections:  “GSEP  sounds  much  fuller,  Demucs  3  
still
 
has
 
this
 
"issue"
 
with
 
not
 
preserving
 
complex
 
drums'
 
dynamics”
 
it
 
refers
 
to
 
e.g.
 
not
 
cancelling
 
some
 
hi-hats
 
even
 
in
 
instrumentals.
  It  happens  that  some  instruments  can  be  deleted  from  all  stems.  “From  what  I've  heard,  [it]  
gets
 
the
 
results
 
by
 
separating
 
each
 
stem
 
individually
 
(rather
 
than
 
subtractive
 
/
 
inverting
 
etc.),
 
but
 
this
 
means
 
some
 
sounds
 
get
 
lost
 
in
 
between
 
the
 
cracks
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
those
 
bits
 
by
 
inverting
 
the
 
gsep
 
stems
 
and
 
lining
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
original
 
source,
 
you
 
should
 
then
 
be
 
left
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
stuff
 
gsep
 
didn't
 
catch”.
 Also,  I'd  experiment  with  the  result  achieved  with  Demucs  ft  model,  and  apply  inversion  for  
just
 
the
 
specific
 
stem
 
you
 
have
 
your
 
sounds
 
missing.
 
  As  for  June  2023  gsep  is  still  the  best  in  most  cases  for  stems,  not  anywhere  close  to  being  
dead
  gsep  loves  to  show  off  with  loud  synths  and  orchestra  elements,  every  other  mdx/demucs  
model
 
fail
 
with
 
those
 
types
 
of
 
things
  Processing    After  your  track  is  uploaded  (when  5  moving  bars  disappear)  it’s  very  fast,  and  it  takes  3-4  
minutes
 
for
 
one
 
track
 
to
 
be
 
separated
 
using
 
2
 
stem
 
option
 
(processing
 
takes
 
around
 
20
 
seconds).
 
If
 
5
 
bars
 
are
 
moving
 
longer
 
than
 
expected
 
track
 
upload
 
time,
 
and
 
you
 
see
 
that
 
nothing
 
uses
 
your
 
internet
 
upload,
 
simply
 
press
 
CTRL+R
 
and
 
retry,
 
if
 
still
 
the
 
same,
 
log
 
off
 
and
 
log
 
in
 
again.
 
It
 
can
 
rarely
 
happen
 
that
 
the
 
upload
 
stuck
 
(e.g.
 
when
 
you
 
minimize
 
the
 
browser
 
on
 
mobile
 
or
 
switch
 
tabs).
  Generally  it’s  very  fast  and  long  after  the  very  first  GSEP  days,  I  needed  to  wait  briefly  in  
queue
 
twice
 
at
 
6-9
 
PM
 
CEST,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
once
 
on
 
Sunday
 
in
 
weekend
 
of
 
adding
 
new
 
model
 
once
 
in
 
my
 
whole
 
life
 
I
 
waited
 
around
 
7
 
minutes.
 
Usually
 
you
 
wait
 
in
 
a
 
queue
 
longer
 
than
 
processing
 
takes,
 
so
 
it’s
 
bloody
 
fast.
  ___  (outdated)    If  your  stems  can’t  be  downloaded  after  you  click  the  download  button,  go  to  Tools  for  
Developers
 
in
 
your
 
browser
 
and
 
open
 
the
 
console
 
and
 
retry.
 
Now
 
you
 
should
 
see
 
an
 
error
 
with
 
file
 
address
 
and
 
your
 
file
 
name
 
in
 
it.
 
You
 
can
 
simply
 
copy
 
the
 
address
 
to
 
the
 
address
 
bar
 
and
 
start
 
downloading
 
it.
 (Outdated  -  3rd  model  changes)  The  quality  of  hi-hats  is  enhanced,  sometimes  at  the  cost  of  
less
 
vivid
 
snare
 
in
 
less
 
busy
 
mix,
 
while
 
it’s
 
usually
 
better
 
in
 
busy
 
mix
 
now,
 
but
 
it
 
sometimes
 
confuses
 
snare
 
in
 
tracks
 
when
 
it
 
sounds
 
similar
 
to
 
hi
 
hat
 
making
 
it
 
worse
 
than
 
it
 
was.
 
So
 
a
 
trap
 
with
 
lots
 
of
 
repetitive
 
hi-hats
 
and
 
also
 
tracks
 
with
 
a
 
busy
 
mix
 
should
 
sound
 
better
 
now.
