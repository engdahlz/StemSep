    steps  to  clean  up  the  vocal  from  instrumental  residues  first,  and  invert  it  manually  to  get  cleaner  instrumental  to  separate  with  instrumental  model  to  get  rid  of  vocal  residues.  Tutorial   14.  To  not  clean  silences  from  instrumental  residues  in  the  vocal  stem  manually,  you  can  use  a  noise  gate  in  even  Audacity.  Video In  some  cases,  using  noise  reduction  tool  and  picking  noise  profile  might  be  necessary.  Video  15.  Choice  of  good  models  for  ensemble   Use  only  instrumental  models  for  ensemble  if  you  have  some  vocal  residues  (and  possibly  
vice

-
 
use
 
only
 
vocal
 
models
 
for
 
ensemble
 
for
 
vocals
 
to
 
get
 
less
 
instrumental
 
residues)
 
-
 
mainly
 
used
 
in
 
times
 
when
 
there
 
was
 
still
 
strong
 
division
 
between
 
vocal
 
and
 
instrumental
 
models
 
(before
 
MDX23C
 
release).
 
Now
 
it
 
can
 
narrow
 
down
 
to
 
picking
 
only
 
models
 
which

carefully,
 
and

the

results
 
to
 
make
 
an
 
ensemble.
  16.  For  vocals  with  vocoder   You  can  use  5HP  Karaoke  (e.g.  with  aggression  settings  raised  up)  or  Karaoke  2  model  
(UVR5
 
or
 
Colabs).
 
Try
 
out
 
separating
 
the
 
result
 
as
 
well
 
(outdated
 
models).
 "If  you  have  a  track  with  3  different  vocal  layers  at  different  parts,  it's  better  to  only  isolate  the  
parts
 
with
 
'two
 
voices
 
at
 
once'
 
so
 
to
 
speak"
 Be  aware  that  BS-Roformer  model  ver.  2024.04  on  MVSEP  is  better  on  vocoder  than  the  
viperx’
 
model.
  17.  Find  some  leaked  or  official  instrumental  for  inversion    To  get  better  vocals  If  you're  struggling  hard  getting  some  of  the  vocals:  "I  used  an  instrumental  that  I  don't  remember  where  I  found  it  (I'm  assuming  most  likely  
somewhere
 
on
 
YouTube)
 
and
 
inverted
 
it
 
and
 
then
 
used
 
MDX
 
(KAR
 
v2)
 
on
 
x-minus
 
and
 
then
 
RX
 
10
 
after.
 I  Just  tried  the  one-off  Bandcamp  and  funnily  enough  it  didn't  work  with  an  invert  as  good  as  
the
 
remake
 
that
 
I
 
used
 
from
 
YouTube,
 
but
 
I
 
don't
 
remember
 
which
 
remake
 
it
 
was
 
I
 
downloaded
 
because
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
while
 
ago"
  18.  Fix  for  ~"ah  ha  hah  ah"  vocal  residues   Try  out  some  L/R  inverting,  try  out  to  separate  multiple  times  to  get  rid  of  some  vocal  pop-ins  
like
