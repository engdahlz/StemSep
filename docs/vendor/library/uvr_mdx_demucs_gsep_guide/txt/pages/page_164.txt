    “One  of  my  favorite  instrumental  models,  Roformer-like  quality.  For  busy  songs  it  works  great,  for  trap/acoustic  etc.  Roformer  is  better  due  to  SCNet  bleed”  -  
becruily
 “bring[s]  such  near  perfect  instrumentals”  vs  the  previous  XL  models  “It's  high  fullness  version  for  instrumental  prepared  by  becruily.”  It  can  also  be  an  insane  vocal  model  too.   -  Gabox  experimental  Inst_FV8 a.k.a.  Gabox  V8  -  previously  exclusive  uvronline  model  via  special  link  (free/premium)  It  gives  decent  results  too.  “it's  on  the  higher  bleedless  side”  -  Rainboomdash  Previous  epoch  of  the  FV8B  model,  previously  only  on  uvronline.   -  Gabox  INSTV7 (yaml)  |  MVSEP  |  Colab |  Huggingface /  2  |  “F”,  for  fullness,  “V”  for  version.  Inst.  fullness:  33.22,  bleedless:  40.71,  SDR:  16.51  *)  Phase  fixer  Colab/UVR’s  Phase  Swapper  (for  less  noise;  e.g.  with  FT3  by  Unwa  vocal  model  as  source).  “I  hear  less  noise  compared  to  v1e,  but  it  has  a  worse  bleedless  metric”  and  might  be  less  
full.
 It  might  still  have  too  much  noise  like  v1e  for  some  people,  but  less.  
“Relatively
 
full/noisy
 
model.
 
Fvx
 
[below]
 
is
 
a
 
sort
 
of
 
middle
 
ground
 
between
 
v3
 
and
 
v7.”
 
More
 
fullness
 
than
 
V6,
 
but
 
vs
 
v1e,
 
sometimes
 
“leaves
 
noises
 
throughout
 
the
 
song,
 
sometimes
 
vocal
 
remnants
 
in
 
the
 
verse
 
of
 
the

 Gabox  claims  it's  not  the  same  as  V7  on  uvronline,  but  FV7z,  despite  both  appear  on  the  list  while  using  special  link  for:  free/premium.   -  Inst_GaboxFv8 v2  model  (yaml)  |  Colab  Inst.  fullness:  33.21,  bleedless:  40.73,  SDR:  16.57  Usually  referred  to  as  just  Inst_GaboxFv8  without  v2.  Since  its  release,  the  checkpoint  has  
been
 
updated
 
on
 
11.05.25
 
(same
 
file
 
name),
 
metrics
 
have
 
changed
 
(updated
 
above).
 “v8  from  uvronline  and  Fv8  from  huggingface  are  completely  different  models”  -  maybe  it’s  
the
 
v1
 
model.
 
Also,
 
don’t
 
confuse
 
with
 
INSTV8.
 
“Good
 
result
 
for
 
bleedless
 
instead,
 
fullness
 
went
 
down
 
instead
 
of
 
up
 
a
 
little.”
 
Might
 
be
 
an
 
interesting
 
competitor
 
to
 
Unwa
 
inst
 
v2
 
which
 
is
 
muddier.
 
 Inst.  fullness:  35.57,  bleedless:  38.06,  SDR:  16.51  are  the  metrics  of  the  old  v1  model  
(unavailable).
 
Unsure
 
if
 
uvronline
 
uses
 
the
 
old
 
fv8.

 It  has  “v1+  metallic  noise”  -  Gabox  VS  V1e+  “A  bit  cleaner-sounding  and  has  less  filtering/watery  artifacts.  Both  models  are  
prone
 
to
