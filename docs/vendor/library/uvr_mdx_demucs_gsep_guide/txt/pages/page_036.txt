 Vocal  bleedless  is  the  best  among  all  SCNet  variants  on  MVSEP.  Metrics.   IHF  stands  for  “Improved  high  frequencies”.  Vocal  bleedless  28.31,  fullness  17.98  “certainly  sounds  better  than  classic  SCNet  XL  (...)  less  crossbleeding  of  vocals  in

  -  Great  news!  MVSEP  now  allows  sorting  scores  on  the  Multisong  Leaderboard by  SDR,  fullness,  bleedless,  aura_stft,  aura_mrstft,  log_wmse,  l1_freq,  si_sdr.  
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
Gabox
 
(and
 
probably
 
sometimes
 
becruily)
 
used
 
to
 
give
 
funny
 
names
 
to
 
their
 
evaluations,
 
so
 
finding
 
proper
 
model
 
names
 
on
 
the
 
leaderboard
 
is
 
sometimes
 
impossible.
 
But
 
I’ve
 
tracked
 
down
 
all
 
possible
 
models
 
with
 
their
 
metrics
 
and
 
proper
 
names
 
in
 
the
 instrumentals and  vocal models  section,  so  no  worries.  Also,  metrics  beside  SDR  are  not  available  for  old  evaluations  where  they  weren’t  listed  in  the  model  details  yet.  You  can  find  more  info  about  bleedless/fullness  metrics  here.  Log  WMSE  metric  is  good  “at  least  for  drums  or  anything  rich  in  low  frequency  content”  -

  -  “Dango  launched  their  new  instrumental  model  https://tuanziai.com/en-US/blog/684841907c8c85686c1b3da6”  It’s  version  11.  “there  is  no  opportunity  to  try  at  least  3  complete  tracks  for  free.”
