    -  Be  aware  that  MDX23C  Inst  Voc  HQ2  is  not  accessible  in  beta  Roformer  patch  when  VIP  code  is  inserted.  You  need  to  download  the  model  file  manually,  and  paste  into  models\MDX_Net_Models  folder.   (Config  is  detected  automatically,  as  it  uses  existing  model_2_stem_full_band_8k  config  -  
the
 
same
 
as
 
for
 
Inst
 
Voc
 
HQ)
  -  UVR  Denoise  non-lite  model  disappeared  from  Download  Center.  Here  it  is:  https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/all_public_uvr_models/UVR-DeNoise.pth  -  You  cannot  use  some  models  from  x-minus/uvronline.app  or  used  on  MVSEP,  e.g.  used  for  
Ensemble
 
of
 
4
 
and
 
8
 
models
 
in
 
UVR,
 
as
 
they
 
contain
 
models
 
not
 
available
 
in
 
UVR,
 
and
 
not
 
available
 
for
 
download.
 
You
 
can
 
only
 
perform
 
manual
 
ensemble
 
of
 
single
 
models
 
processed
 
by
 
MVSEP
 
or
 
x-minus,
 
in
 
UVR,
 
but
 
it
 
will
 
not
 
give
 
the
 
same
 
result
 
as
 
ensemble
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
as
 
it
 
uses
 
code
 
more
 
similar
 
to
 
MDX23
 
Colab
 
code,
 
so
 
sometimes
 
weighted
 
ensemble
 
instead
 
of.
 
e.g.
 
avg
 
spec
 
(don’t
 
confuse
 
with
 
MDX23C
 
arch
 
models).
  -  E.g.  for  16.10.23,  “MVSep  Ensemble  of  4”  consists  of  1648  previous  epoch  (maybe  later  
updated
 
to
 
16.66),
 
VitLarge,
 
and
 
Demucs
 
2023
 
Vocals
 
and
 
beside
 
the
 
first,
 
none
 
of
 
these
 
models
 
work
 
in
 
UVR,
 
even
 
if
 
downloaded
 
manually
 
(plus
 
VitLarge
 
arch
 
is
 
not
 
supported
 
in
 
UVR
 
at
 
all).
 
Currently,
 
there
 
are
 
various
 
ensembles
 
to
 
choose
 
from
 
on
 
MVSEP.
 As  for  4/8  models  ensemble  on  MVSEP  -  they’re  all  only  for  premium  users,  as  many  
resources
 
and
 
models
 
are
 
being
 
used
 
to
 
output
 
these
 
results
  -  1648  on  MVSEP  is  MDX23C  HQ1  model  (a.k.a.  8K  FFT)   -  SYHFT  V4  and  V5  beta  by  SYH99999  were  never  publicly  released.  V5  Beta  is  only  on  x-minus.pro/uvronline  and  got  deleted  from  the  main  models  view,  but  
might
 
be
 
still
