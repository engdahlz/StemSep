    “tried  it  on  a  regular  model  (bigBeta5e)  -  the  spectrogram  looks  a  little  more  cut  off  at  the  
high
 
end
 
than
 
without
 
the
 
pitch
 
adjust
 
and
 
overall
 
the
 
vocal
 
sounds
 
a
 
little
 
rounder
 
and
 
not
 
quite
 
as
 
harsh
 
(so
 
the
 
transients
 
are
 
not
 
so
 
nuclear)”

  70.  Fixing  missing  sound  after  separation  of  multistem  models   With  certain  at  least  4  stem  models,  you  might  find  out  that  the  inversion  of  a  mixdown  of  
those
 
4
 
stems
 
vs
 
original
 
mixture
 
is
 
different.
 
So
 
you
 
might
 
get
 
an
 
additional
 
5th
 
stem
 
that
 
way
 
-
 
your
 
own
 
“other”.
 
It
 
might
 
be
 
useful
 
if
 
some
 
instruments
 
got
 
missed,
 
or
 
simply
 
for
 
remastering
 
purposes
 
where
 
not
 
having
 
any
 
missed
 
bits
 
of
 
audio
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
your
 
work.
  71 .  Start  separation  in  a  different  place  of  the  song   Cut  it  manually.  The  result  might  resemble  changing  chunks  setting  a  bit.   72.  Use  instrumental  model  result  as  pre-processor  for  vocal  model   One  of  suggested  RVC  workflows
