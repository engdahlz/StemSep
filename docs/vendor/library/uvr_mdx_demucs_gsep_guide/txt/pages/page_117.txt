     Using  the  settings  above  on  patch  #2,  with  GPU  acceleration  it  will  take  39m  28s  for  3:28  
song
 
using
 
1296
 
model
 
on
 
RX
 
470
 
4GB
 
and
 
18
 
minutes
 
for
 
Kim
 
Mel-Roformer
 
and
 
3:01
 
song.
 Using  HQ_4  is  much  faster  than  realtime  using  default  settings,  but  even  longer  than  
accelerated
 
Roformer,
 
when
 
on

800MHz.
  On  Mac  M1  using  the  patch  above,  it  takes  9  minutes  to  process  a  3-minute  song  using  BS-Roformer  (dim_t  1101,  batch  size  2,  overlap  8)  with  “constant  throttling”.  Click And  below  4  minutes  for  Kim  Mel-Roformer  (overlap  1,  dim  801).  Click  -  Settings  working  for  6GB  AMD  GPUs:  dim_t  601  or  701  at  the  bottom  of  the  yaml  file  and  
overlap
 
6
 
or
 
7
 
in
 
GUI.
  -  Like  I  mentioned,  overlap  8  can  be  good  enough  too  when  dim_t=801  is  set  (the  fastest  
setting
 
before
 
SDR
 
getting
 
drastically
 
reduced),
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
other
 
cases
 
you
 
shouldn’t
 
exceed
 
6,
 
while
 
2
 
should
 
provide
 
the
 
best
 
quality
 
in
 
most
 
cases.
  -  1602  (or  rather  1601)  dim_t  might  lead  to  less  wateriness,  but  turns  out  in  cost  of  a  bit  more  
of
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
  -  “In  theory,  max  overlap  value  [for  Roformer  separations  without  mentioned  issues  in  UVR]  
can
 
be
 
known
 
with
 
formula:
  (dim_t  -  1)  /  100  =  Max_overlap_value   if  dim_t  =  801:  (801  -  1)  /  100  =  8   if_dim_t  =  1101:  (1101  -1)  /  100  =  10  [jarredou  wrote  10  here,  but  it’s  actually  11]   Above  that  max  value,  some  parts  of  the  input  will  not  be  processed.   The  lower  the  overlap  value  is,  the  more  overlap  is  used,  so  better  SDR.   -  Some  Rofos  models  still  have  wrong  config  by  default,  with  dim_t=256,  so  max  overlap  
value
 
for
 
that
 
is
 
2.
 
That's
 
why
 
I've
 
advised
 
to
 
stick
 
to
 
overlap=2”
 
-
 
jarredou
 
 So  in  times  before  dim_t  was  known  how  to  be  correctly  set,  so  now  overlaps  can  be  even  
set
 
to
 
8
 
now
 
when
 
dim_t=801
 
is
 
set]).”
 The  same  thing  applies  for  both  BS  and  Mel  Roformers  in  UVR.  “audio.dim_t  value  is  not  used  with  roformers  in  ZFTurbo  script,  it  uses  audio.chunk_size  
and
 
then
 
it's
 
parameters
 
in
 
the
 
model
 
part
 
of
 
config.”
