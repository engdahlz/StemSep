    Not  really  demanding  case,  so  without  modern  vocal  chain  in  the  mix,  but  probably  enough  
to
 
present
 
the
 
general
 
idea
 
of
 
how
 
different
 
presets
 
sound
 
here.
 
So,
 
more
 
forgiving
 
song
 
to
 
MDX23C
 
model
 
this
 
time,
 
and
 
less
 
aggressive
 
models
 
with
 
more
 
clarity.
  Genre:  (older  rap)  Title:  (O.S.T.R.  -  Tabasko  [2002])  BEST  Preset  :  3  Music  :   Versus  P4,  hi-hats  are  preserved  better  in  P3.   Snare  in  P3  is  not  so  muffled  like  in  P4.   HQ_3  has  even  more  muffled  snares  than  in  P4.   P3  still  had  less  vocal  residues  than  MDX23C  HQ  1648  model,  although  the  whole  P3  result  
was
 
more
 
muffled,
 
but
 
residues
 
are
 
smartly
 
muffled
 
too.
 
 MDX23C  had  like  more  faithfully  sounding  snares  than  P3,  to  the  extent  that  they  can  be  
perceived
 
brighter
 
(but
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
even
 
on
 
a
 
more
 
forgiving
 
song
 
like
 
this,
 
are
 
more
 
persistent
 
in
 
MDX23C
 
than
 
in
 
P3).
 
  Sometimes  it  depended  on  specific  fragment  where  P4  and  where  P3  has  more  vocal  
residues
 
in
 
that
 
specific
 
case,
 
so
 
P3
 
turned
 
out
 
being
 
pretty
 
much
 
balanced,
 
although
 
P4
 
had
 
less
 
consistent
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
although
 
still
 
not
 
so
 
few
 
like
 
HQ_3,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
that
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
problem
 
(HQ_3
 
is
 
really
 
muffled).
 
If
 
it
 
was
 
4
 
stems,
 
then
 
I'd
 
describe
 
P3/4
 
as
 
having
 
very
 
good
 
"other"
 
stem
 
but
 
drums
 
too
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned.
  WORST  Preset  (in  that  case)  :  1  Music  :  Too  much  consistent  vocal  residues  There's  a  similar  situation  in  P2,  but  at  least  P2  has  brighter  snares  than  even  MDX23C.   In  other  songs,  P1  can  be  better  than  P2,  leaving  less  vocal  residues  in  specific  fragments  
for
 
a
 
specific
 
artist,
 
but
 
noticeably
 
more
 
for
 
others.
  Preset  4  with  setting  slow  (but  not  the  slowest)  takes  16  minutes  for  5  minutes  song  on  T4  in  
free
 
Colab
 
(performance
 
of
 
~GTX
 
3050).
 
For
 
3:30
 
track,
 
it
 
takes
 
13:30
 
for
 
the
 
slowest
 
setting.
 
In
 
KF
 
5.1
 
with
 
default
 
chunks
 
500K
 
and
 
slowest
 
setting,
 
for
 
4:50
 
song
 
and
 
preset
 
2
 
it
 
took
 
<10
 
minutes,
 
preset
 
3,
 
12
 
minutes.
  VS  preset  3,  the  one  from  the  screenshot (now  added  as  preset  5)  is  more  noisy  and  has  more  vocal  residues,  mainly  in  quiet  places  or  when  there  is  no  instrumental.  Processing  
time
 
for
 
6:16
 
track
 
on
 
medium
 
setting
 
is
 
22:19
 
minutes.
 
But
 
it
 
definitely
 
has
 
more
 
clarity
 
over
 
preset
 
3.
 
And
 
there
 
is
 
still
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
in
 
Preset
 
1
 
and
 
2,
 
which
 
have
 
more
 
clarity,
 
but
 
tend
 
to
 
have
 
too
 
many
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
some
 
tracks.
 
Hence,
 
preset
 
5
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
universal
 
for
 
now.
