    [Errors/freezes  are]  already  happening  during  Demucs  separation  when  you  do  4-stem  
separation
 
with
 
files
 
longer
 
than
 
~10-15

 With  v.  2.4,  30  minute  file  was  too  long,  and  the  Colab  hung  on  Roformer  model  separation.   The  Colab  combines  results  of  then  the  best  public  models  of  different  architectures  using  
custom
 
weights
 
for
 
every
 
model
 
(like
 
a
 
manually
 
set
 
volume
 
for
 
every
 
stem,
 
then
 
mixed
 
with
 
others
 
together),
 
instead
 
of
 
usual
 
methods
 
of
 
ensembling
 
as
 
in
 
UVR,
 
which
 
in
 
e.g.
 
“avg”
 
averages
 
results
 
of
 
all
 
models
 
(so
 
there
 
the
 
same
 
volume
 
is
 
used
 
for
 
every
 
stem).
 
More
 
tricks
 
in
 
the
 
Colab
 
explained
 
further
 
below.
  As  of  v.  2.5  “Baseline  ensemble  is  made  with  Kim  Melband  Rofo,  InstVocHQ  and  selected  
1296
 
or
 
1297
 
BS
 
Rofo”
 
(so
 
Kim
 
Rofo
 
was
 
added,
 
and
 
VitLarge
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
default).
  ~“Free  Google  Colab  gives  you  3h  per  day,  then  you  need  to  wait  24h,  and  next  day  it  gives  
you
 
2
 
free
 
hours,
 
after
 
24h
 
wait
 
you'll
 
get
 
only
 
1h,
 
and
 
24h
 
later,
 
2h
 
of
 
free
 
credits,
 
the
 
day
 
after
 
1h
 
of
 
free
 
credits,
 
etc...
 
and
 
once
 
in
 
that
 
pattern,
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
wait
 
48h
 
to
 
recover
 
the
 
3h
 
back.”
 
You
 
can
 
just
 
change
 
Google
 
account
 
when
 
GPU
 
limit
 
is
 
reached,
 
but
 
remember
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
new
 
account
 
during
 
mounting
 
GDrive,
 
otherwise
 
you
 
may
 
get
 
an
 
error.
  “I've  opened  a  donation  account  for  those  who  would  want  to  support  me:  https://ko-fi.com/jarredou”    Troubleshooting   -  “PytorchStreamReader  error”  simply  restart  the  environment,  it’s  a  random  issue  occurring  in  the  Colab.   -  “usage:  inference.py  [-h]  --input_audio  INPUT_AUDIO  [INPUT_AUDIO  ...]  --output_folder”  (and  the  whole  list  of  arguments  is  shown  below)  launch  mount  to  GDrive  cell  (it’s  not  being  done  automatically)  or  change  file  input  and

path
  -  “ValueError:  Mountpoint  must  not  already  contain  files”  (on  attempt  of  mounting  GDrive),  go  to  file  manager  on  the  left,  and  you  probably  have  
GDrive

with
 
empty
 
folders
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
delete
 
from
 
there
 
first,
 
and
 
retry
 
(might
 
happen
 
when
 
you
 
use
 
GDrive
 
on
 
this
 
account
 
while
 
it’s
 
nto
 
mounted
 
yet,
 
but
 
Colab
 
works).
  -  "no  such  file"   (error  in  v2.3  while  batch  processing)  “it's  square  brackets  [  ]   when  it  sees  a  [  in  the  filename,  it  then  thinks  there's  two  additional  [  ]  in  the  name   changing  to  regular  parentheses  does  work”
