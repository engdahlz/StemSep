    (...).  Works  great  as  a  phase  fixer  reference  to  remove  Mel  Roformer  inst  models  noise”  it  
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
remove
 
instruments

 Added  to  phase  fixer  Colab.   -   Inst_GaboxFv8 model  |  yaml |  Colab checkpoint  has  been  updated,  metrics  could  have  changed,  but  most  of  the  model  qualities  might  remain  similar   -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  new  Drumsep  MelBand  Roformer  (4  stems)  model  on  MVSep  (old  one  
was
 
removed).
 
It
 
gives
 
the
 
best
 
metrics
 
with
 
big
 
gap
 
for
 
kick,
 
snare
 
and
 
cymbals.”

 (metrics;  only  toms  are  worse  SDR-wise  vs  previous  SCNet  Drumsep  models)   -  Gabox  released  voc_fv5 vocal  model  |  yaml voc  bleedless:  29.50,  fullness:  20.67,  SDR:  10.56  “fv5  sounds  a  bit  fuller  than  fv4,  but  the  vocal  chops  end  up  in  the  vocal  stem.  In  my  opinion,  fv4  is  better  for  removing  vocal  chops  from  the  vocal  stem”  -  neoculture.  Examples “v5  is  slightly  fuller,  v4  is  less  full  but  also  slightly  more  careful  about  what  it  considers  as  
vocals.
 
I
 
think
 
b5e
 
is
 
the
 
fullest
 
overall,
 
but
 
it's
 
a
 
bit
 
much
 
sometimes.
 
Pretty
 
sure
 
the
 
gabox
 
models
 
are
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
accurate
 
with
 
vocal/instrument
 
detection.”
