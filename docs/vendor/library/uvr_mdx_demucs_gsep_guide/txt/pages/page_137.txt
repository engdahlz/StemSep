     Official  Colab (video  guide in  case  of  problems)   Colab forked  by  Kubinka  (can  show  error  now  after  1.2  update)   GUI  for  offline  use:  https://github.com/Captain-FLAM/KaraFan/tree/master  It  gives  very  clean  instrumentals  with  much  less  of  consistent  vocal  residues  than  in  MDX23  
2.0-2.2
 
and
 
Ripple/Bytedance.
  (might  have  been  changed)  You  can  also  disable  SRS  there  to  get  a  bit  cleaner  result,  but  in  
cost
 
of
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
How
 
detestable
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
without
 
SRS,
 
depends
 
on
 
a
 
track
 
-
 
e.g.
 
if
 
it
 
has
 
heavy
 
compressed
 
modern
 
vocals
 
and
 
lots
 
of
 
places
 
with
 
not
 
busy
 
mix
 
(when
 
not
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
instruments
 
play).
 
Disabled
 
SRS
 
adds
 
a
 
substantial
 
amount
 
of
 
information
 
above
 
17.7kHz.
  One  of  our  users  had  problems  caused  seemingly  by  empty  Colab  Notebooks  folder  which  
he
 
needed
 
to
 
delete.
 
Could
 
have
 
been
 
something
 
else
 
they
 
did
 
too,
 
though.
  -  New  epoch  of  new  BVE  model  has  been  added  to  x-minus  “In  some  parts  the  new  BVE  is  better,  in  some  it's  worse.  Still  a  great  model”   >  To  get  better  results,  you  can  downmix  the  result  to  mono  and  repeat  the  separation   -  For  people  having  issues  with  Boosty  x-minus  payment:  https://boosty.to/uvr/posts/5d88402e-9eb1-4046-a00a-cf8b09e27561  -  Sometimes  for  instrumental  residues  in  vocals,  AIs  for  voice  recorded  with  home  
microphone
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
(e.g.
 
Goyo
 
[now
 
Supertone
 
Clear],
 
or
 
even
 
Krisp,
 
RTX
 
Voice,
 
AMD
 
Noise
 
Suppression,
 
Elgato
 
Wave
 
Link
 
3.0
 
Voice
 
Focus
 
or
 
Adobe
 
Podcast
 
as
 
a
 
last
 
resort)
 
it
 
all
 
depends
 
on
 
type
 
of
 
vocals
 
and
 
how
 
destructive
 
the
 
AI
 
can
 
get.
