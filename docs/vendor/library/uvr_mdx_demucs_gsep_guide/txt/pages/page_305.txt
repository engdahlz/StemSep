    MedleyVox  (not  available  in  UVR)  will  be  useful  in  the  end  in  cases  when  everything  else  
fails
 
after
 
you
 
obtain
 
all
 
vocals
 
in
 
one
 
stem,
 
as
 
it's
 
very
 
narrowband.
 
But
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
AudioSR
 
on
 
it
 
afterwards.

“I

since

128kbps
 
I
 
did
 
something
 
really
 
odd
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
higher
 
quality
 
instrumental:
 I  inverted  the  128kbps  AAC  YouTube  rip  into  the  original  to  get  the  acapella  I  took  the  subtracted  acapella  and  ran  it  through  AI  (Mel-Roformer  2024.10)  to  reduce  the  
compression
 
artifacts
 I  then  inverted  the  isolated  acapella  and  mixed  it  with  the  lossless  to  get  an...  unusual  
lossless
 
instrumental
 
file?
 
Also,
 
the
 
OPUS
 
stream
 
goes
 
up
 
to
 
20kHz,
 
but
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
the
 
sample
 
rate
 
difference
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
cause
 
issues,
 
so
 
I
 
ended
 
up
 
ripping
 
AAC
 
(OPUS
 
is
 
48khz
 
while
 
most
 
music
 
is
 
44.1kHz)”
  61.  Join  the  best  fragments  from  various  models  
 
E.g.
 
unwa
 
inst
 
models
 
might
 
be
 
noisy
 
at
 
times,
 
so
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
specific
 
fragments
 
of
 
v1e/v1/v2
 
fitting
 
across
 
the
 
song,
 
or
 
e.g.
 
beta
 
4
 
vocal
 
model
 
in
 
certain
 
fragments
 
where
 
it’s
 
not
 
enough,
 
though
 
it
 
is
 
more
 
muddy,
 
but
 
less
 
noisy
 
than
 
unwa’s
 
inst
 
models.
 
In
 
some
 
cases,
 
if
 
it’s
 
still
 
not
 
enough,
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
BS-Roformer
 
models
 
like
 
unwa’s
 
Large
 
or
 
e.g.
 
24.10
 
on
 
MVSEP.
 
Just
 
find
 
which
 
model
 
on
 
the
 
list
 
in
 
this
 
document
 
has
 
the
 
least
 
amounts
 
of
 
residues
 
and
 
experiment
 
with
 
the
 
rest
 
starting
 
from
 
models
 
listed
 
at
 
the
 
top.
  62.  Lowpassing  lossless  file  to  20kHz   Sometimes  it’s  a  bit  useful  in  getting  rid  of  some  constant  faint  noise/residues  from  vocals  in  
instrumentals.
 
It
 
might
 
muffle
 
some
 
unwanted
 
parts
 
of
 
instrumental,
 
but
 
some
 
more
 
difficult
 
fragments
 
with
 
more
 
residues
 
than
 
usual
 
might
 
sound
 
better
 
that
 
way.
 
Tested
 
on
 
FLAC
 
16
 
compressed
 
to
 
mp3
 
320kbps,
 
but
 
it
 
should
 
work
 
better
 
with
 
lowpassing
 
using
 
EQ
 
instead
 
of
 
compressing.
 
Other
 
example
 
values
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
using
 
are
 
19kHz
 
(mp3
 
VBR
 
V0
 
cutoff)/17.7kHz
 
(cutoff
 
of
 
some
 
narrowband
 
models)/16kHz
 
(cutoff
 
of
 
mp3
 
and
 
AAC
 
128kbps)/14.7kHz
 
(D1581
 
model
 
cutoff).
 A  possible  explanation  of  why  it  might  sometimes  work  is:  sometimes,  e.g.  more  oldschool  
hip-hop
 
beats
 
might
 
have
 
less
 
higher
 
tones,
 
or
 
even
 
none
 
above
 
16kHz,
 
so
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
in
 
this
 
area
 
might
 
come
 
from
 
vocals
 
in
 
a
 
mixture.
 
You
