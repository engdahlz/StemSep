     -  Always  close  the  environment  in  Environment  before  you  close  the  tab  with  the  Colab.  That  way,  you  will  be  able  to  connect  to  the  Colab  again  after  some  time,  even  if  you  
previously
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
runtime
 
and
 
stopped
 
using
 
it.
 
Not
 
shutting
 
down
 
the
 
runtime
 
before
 
exit,
 
makes
 
it
 
wait
 
in
 
idle,
 
and
 
hitting
 
timeout.
 
Then
 
the
 
error
 
of
 
limit
 
reached
 
will
 
appear
 
after
 
you'll
 
try
 
to
 
connect
 
to
 
Colab
 
again
 
if
 
it
 
wasn't
 
closed
 
before.
 
Then
 
you'll
 
need
 
to
 
wait
 
up
 
to
 
24h,
 
or
 
switch
 
Colab
 
account,
 
while
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
Google
 
account
 
as
 
for
 
Colab
 
in
 
the
 
mounting
 
cell
 
(otherwise,
 
it
 
will
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
error
 
when
 
you'll
 
use
 
different
 
account
 
for
 
Colab
 
and
 
different
 
for
 
GDrive
 
mounting).
  -  New  layer  models  may  not  work  with  272  window  size  causing  following  error:  “raise  ValueError('h1_shape[3]  must  be  greater  than  h2_shape[3]')  ValueError:  h1_shape[3]  must  be  greater  than  h2_shape[3]”   -  (fixed)  Sometimes  on  running  mounting  cell  you  can  have  short  “~from  Google  Colab  error”  
on
 
startup.
 
It
 
will
 
happen
 
if
 
you
 
didn’t
 
log
 
into
 
any
 
account
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
right
 
corner
 
of
 
the
 
Colab.
 
Sometimes
 
it
 
will
 
show
 
a
 
blue
 
“log
 
in”
 
button,
 
but
 
actually
 
it’s
 
logged
 
in,
 
and
 
Colab
 
will
 
work.
  -  A  network  error  occurred,  and  the  request  could  not  be  completed.  GapiError:  A  network  error  occurred  and  the  request  could  not  be  completed.   In  order  to  fix  these  error  in  Colabs,  go  to  hosts  file  in  your  
c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
 
and
 
check
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
have
 
any
 
lines
 
looking
 
like:
 127.0.0.1  clients.google.com  127.0.0.1  clients1.google.com  etc.  It  can  be  introduced  by  RipX  Pro  DAW.   -  Various  Colabs  might  occasionally  get  unstable,  and  the  environment  disk  might  get  
unmounted,
 
or
 
you
 
might
 
get
 
weird
 
errors.
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
simply
 
kill
 
the
 
current
 
environment
 
and
 
start
 
over
  -  These  are  all  the  lines  which  fix  problems  in  our  VR  Colabs  since  the  beginning  of  the  year  
when
 
new
 
versions
 
of
 
these
 
dependencies
 
became
 
incompatible
 
(but
 
usually
 
one
 
Colab
 
linked
 
is
 
forked
 
when
 
told
 
and
 
up-to-date
 
with
 
these
 
necessary
 
fixes
 
applied
 
already)
  !pip  install  soundfile==0.11.0  !pip  install  librosa==0.9.1  !pip  install  torch==1.13.1  !pip  install  yt-dlp=2022.11.11  !pip  install  git+https://github.com/ytdl-org/ytdl-nightly.git@2023.08.07   Later  in  February  2024  we  needed  to  switch  to  older  Python  3.8  in  order  to  make  numpy  
work
 
correctly
 
with
 
used
 
deprecated
 
functions.
