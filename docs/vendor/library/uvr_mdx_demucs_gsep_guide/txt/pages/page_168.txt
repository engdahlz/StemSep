  Higher  fullness  (but  with  more  noise)  (sorted  by  fullness)   0)  Gabox  INSTV6N (N  for  noise/fullness)  |  yaml |  Colab |  SESA |  Huggingface /  2 |  metrics:   Inst.  fullness :  41.68  (more  than  v1e),  bleedless:  32.63  (N  “noisier  but  fuller”)  To  get  rid  of  noise  in  INSTV6N,  use  Gabox  denoise/debleed model  (yaml)  on  mixture  first,  then  use  INSTV6N  -  “for  some  reason  it  gives  cleaner  results”  (Gabox),  but  it  can’t  remove  
vocal
 
residues.
 Some  people  find  it  having  less  noise  vs  v1e  and  more  fullness.  
Also,
 
it
 
has
 
more
 
fullness
 
vs
 
INSTV6,
 
and
 
more
 
noise,
 
but
 
some
 
people
 
might
 
still
 
prefer
 
v1e.
 
 “v1e  sounds  like  an  "overall"  noise  on  the  song,  while  v6n  kind  of  mixes  into  it.  v6n  also  sounds  like  two  layers,  one  of  noise  that's  just  there.  And  the  other  one  mixes  into  
the
 
song
 
somehow.
 
Using
 
the
 
phase
 
swap
 
barely
 
makes
 
it
 
any
 
better
 
than
 
phase
 
swapping
 
with
 
v1e
 
though”

than
 
even
 
v1e.
 “Despite  v4's  significant  amount  of  noise,  it  seems  to  be  the  only  model  [till  8  February]  that  
gave
 
me
 
a
 
fuller
 
sounding

to

that's
 
actually
