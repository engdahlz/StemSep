Recommended
 
(or
 
with
 
v2/v1
 
instead)
 
esp.
 
when
 
using
 
a
 
phase
 
fixer
 
due
 
to
 
bleed
 
of
 
instruments
 
in
 
the
 
vocal
 
track
 
in

or
 
its
 
fine-tunes
 
used
 
for
 
the
 
tool.

keeps

[though
 
less
 
than
 
becruily
 
vocal]
 
and
 
it
 
has

  0)  Unwa’s  Inst  V2  and  Inst  Gabox  (Avg)  (1120  segments  [6GB  GPU]/4  overlaps)  -

  0)  Max  ensemble  of:  instv1,  instv2  and  inst  v1e   -  erdzo125  
(better

 0b)  Models  ensembled  -  available  only  for  premium  users  on  mvsep.com Now  also  added  “instrumental  high  fullness”  variant  for  inst,  voc  ensemble.  For  example,  some  lower  inst,  voc  SDR  ensembles  available  might  be  less  muddy  than  
11.50
 
(e.g.
 
10.44),
 
but
 
the
 
11.50
 
one
 
has
 
the
 
fewer
 
amounts
 
of
 
vocal
 
residues
 
according
 
to
 
bleedless
 
metric,
 
but
 
it
 
can
 
also
 
sound
 
very
 
filtered.
 
Newer

added
 
since
 
then
 (track  the  leaderboard and  click  on  entries  to  see  also  bleedless/fullness  metrics).  (ensembles  on  MVSEP  provide  currently  the  best  of  SDR  scores  for  2  and  4  stem  separators,  higher
