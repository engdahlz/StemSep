    The  code  handles  mono  and  48kHz  files  too,  6:16  (preset  3)  tracks,  and  possibly  9  minutes  
tracks
 
too
 
(but
 
can’t
 
tell
 
if
 
with
 
all
 
presets).
 
It
 
stores

on
 
GDrive,
 
which
 
takes
 
0,8-1,1GB
 
(depending
 
on
 
how
 
many
 
models
 
you’ll
 
use).

  Older  1.3  version  Colab  fork  by  Kubinka  was  deleted.  Colab  fork  made  by  AI  HUB  server  members  also  includes  MDX23C  Inst  Voc  HQ  2  and  
HQ_4
 
models,
 
and
 
contains
 
slow
 
separation
 
fix
 
from
 
the
 
“fixed
 
Colab”.
 
  KaraFan  used  to  have  lots  of  versions  which  differ  in  these  aspects  with  an  aim  to  have  the  
best
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
recent
 
Colab/GUI
 
version.
 
E.g.
 
v.3.1
 
used
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
in
 
1.3
 
version
 
and
 
even
 
more
 
than
 
in
 
HQ_3
 
model
 
on
 
its
 
own,
 
and
 
it
 
got
 
partially
 
fixed
 
in
 
3.2
 
(if
 
not
 
entirely).
 
But
 
1.3
 
irc,
 
had
 
some
 
overlapped
 
frequency
 
issue
 
with
 
SRS
 
disabled,
 
which
 
makes
 
the
 
instrumentals
 
brighter,
 
but
 
it
 
got
 
fixed
 
later.
 
The
 
current
 
version
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
writing
 
this
 
excerpt
 
is
 
4.2,
 
with
 
pretty
 
good
 
opinions
 
for
 
v.4.1
 
shortly
 
before.
   Colab  troubleshooting   -  (no  longer  necessary  in  the  fixed  Colab)  If  you  suffer  from  very  slow  or  unfinishable  separations  in  the  Colab  using  non-MDX23C  models  (e.g.  stuck  on  voc_ft  without  any  
progress),
 
use
 
fixed
 
Colab
 
(the
 
onnxruntime-gpu
 
line
 
added
 
in
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
cell)
  -  Contrary  to  every  other  Colab  in  this  document,  KaraFan  uses  a  GUI  which  launches  after  
executing
 
inference
 
cell.
 
It
 
triggers
 
Google’s
 
timeout
 
security
 
checks
 
frequently
 
esp.
 
in
 
free
 
Colab
 
users,
 
because
 
Google
 
behaves
 
like
 
the
 
separation
 
is
 
not
 
being
 
executed
 
where
 
you
 
do
 
it
 
in
 
GUI,
 
and
 
it’s
 
generally
 
against
 
their
 
policies
 
to
 
execute
 
such
 
code
 
instead
 
pasting
 
commands
 
to
 
execute
 
in
 
Colab
 
cells
 
directly.
 
The
 
same
 
way
 
many
 
RVC
 
Colabs
 
got
 
blocked
 
by
 
Google,
 
but
 
this
 
one
 
is
 
generally
 
not
 
directly
 
for
 
voice
 
cloning,
 
and
 
is
 
not
 
very
 
popular
 
yet,
 
so
 
it
 
wasn’t
 
targeted
 
by
 
Google
 
yet.
  -  Once  you  start  separation,  it  can  get  you  disconnected  from  runtime  quickly,  especially  if  
you
 
miss
 
some
 
multiple
 
captcha
 
prompts
 
(in
 
2024
 
captchas
 
stopped
 
appearing
 
at
 
all,
 
so
 
the
 
user
 
inactivity
 
during
 
separation
 
process
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
no
 
longer
 
checked).
 
  -  After  runtime  disconnection  error,  output  folder  on  e.g.  GDrive  can  be  still  constantly  
populated
 
with
 
new
 
files,
 
while
 
progress
 
bar
 
is
 
not
 
being
 
refreshed
 
after
 
clicking
 
close
 
or
 
even
 
after
 
closing
 
your
 
tab
 
with
 
Colab
 
opened.
 
At
 
certain
 
point
 
it
 
can
 
interrupt
 
the
 
process,
 
leaving
 
you
 
with
 
not
 
all
 
output
 
files.
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
final
 
files
 
always
 
have
 
“Final”
 
in
 
their
 
names.
