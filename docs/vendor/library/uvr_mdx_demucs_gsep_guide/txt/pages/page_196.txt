high

 “Certainly  sounds  better  than  classic  SCNet  XL  (...)  less  crossbleeding  of  vocals  in  
instrumental

complex

  -  Gabox  vocfv7beta3 Mel-Roformer  |  yaml |  Colab voc  bleedless  30.83,  fullness  21.82,  SDR  10.80  “beta  1  and  2...  eh,  pretty  close  to  same  instrumental  bleed,  but  beta  3  def  a  step  up  from  the  two  songs  I  compared  (...)  most  songs  so  far,  fv7beta3  is  fuller  than  fv7beta1,  def  less  robotic  sounding  at  times  (when  a  voice  gets  quiet/hard  to  capture,  and  it  just  fails).  Just  had  another  song  where  fv7beta1  was  fuller  than  fv7beta3,  but  it  was  also  a  lot  noisier  large  majority  of  the  songs  I  tested,  fv7beta3  was  fuller...  I  think  fv7beta3  is  usually  a  bit  
noisier
 
than
 
fv7beta1?
 
But
 
also
 
sounds
 
fuller
 
in
 
those
 
cases,
 
I'd
 
say
 
it's
 
generally
 
worth
 
it
 instrumental  bleed,  usually  worse  with  fv7beta3  versus  fv7beta1,  but  it  depends  fv7beta2  is  always  less  full/less  noise,  but  only  slightly  less  instrumental  bleed  than  
fv7beta1”
