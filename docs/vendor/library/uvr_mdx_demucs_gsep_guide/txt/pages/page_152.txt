    -HQ_3  model  added  to  MDX  Colab (old)   -HV  just  made  a  new  version  of  her  own  updated  MDX  Colab with  all  new  models,  including  HQ_3.  It  lacks  e.g.  Demucs  2  for  Instrumentals  of  vocal  models,  but  in  return  it  allows  using  
YouTube
 
and
 
Deezer
 
links
 
for
 
lossless
 
tracks,
 
with
 
providing
 
ARL,
 
and
 
allows
 
specifying
 
manually
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
file
 
name
 
to
 
process
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
 
Also,
 
for
 
any
 
new
 
models
 
in
 
the
 
future,
 
there's
 
optional
 
input
 
for
 
model
 
settings,
 
to
 
bypass
 
parameters
 
of
 
parameters
 
autoloader.
 
IRC,
 
the
 
Colab
 
stores
 
its
 
files
 
in
 
different
 
path,
 
so
 
be
 
aware
 
about
 
it
 
when
 
uploading
 
tracks
 
for
 
separations
 
on
 
GDrive.
 -  she  has  added  volume  compensation  in  new  revision  (they’re  applied  automatically  for  
each
 
model)
 In  previous  MDX  Colabs there  were  also  min,  avg,  max,  and  chunks,  but  they're  gone  in  HV  Colab.   -  HV  also  made  a  new VR  Colab  which  irc,  now  don’t  clutter  all  your  GDrive,  but  only  downloads  models  which  you  use  (but  without  VR  ensemble)  and  probably  might  work  
without
 
GDrive
 
mounting,
 
but
 
it
 
lacks
 
VR
 
ensemble.
  -  New  MDX  models  added  to  both  variants  of  MVSep  (Kim  inst,  Vocal  1/2,  Main  [vocal  
model],
 
HQ_2)
  -  ZFTurbo’s  MDX23  code  now  requires  less  GPU  memory.  “I  was  able  to  process  file  on  8  
GB
 
card.
 
Now
 
it's
 
default
 
mode.”:
 
6GB
 
VRAM
 
is
 
not
 
enough.
 
Lowering
 
overlaps
 
(e.g.
 
500000
 
instead
 
of
 
1000000)
 
or
 
chunking
 
track
 
manually
 
might
 
be
 
necessary
 
in
 
this
 
case.
 
Also
 
now
 
you
 
can
 
control
 
everything
 
from
 
options:
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
set
 
chunk_size
 
200000
 
and
 
single
 
ONNX.
 
It
 
can
 
possibly
 
work
 
with
 
6GB
 
VRAM
 
that
 
way.
  Overlap  large  and  small  -  controls  overlap  of  song  during  processing.  The  larger  value  the  
slower
 
processing
 
but
 
better
 
quality
 
(both)
  If  you  have  fail  to  allocate  memory  error,  use  --large_gpu  parameter   Sometimes  turning  off  use  large  GPU  and  reducing  chunk  size  from  1000000  to  500000  
helps
  -  Models/AIs  of  the  1st  and  2nd  place  winners  in  MDX23  music  challenge  (ByteDance’s  and  
quickpepper947’s)
 
sadly
 
won’t
 
be
 
released
 
to
 
the
 
public
 
(at
 
least
 
won’t
 
be
 
open-sourced).
 
Maybe
 
in
 
June,
 
ByteDance
 
will
 
be
 
released
 
as
 
an
 
app
 
in
 
worse
 
quality.
 Judging  by  the  few  snippets  we  had:  "the  vocal  output,  yes,  better  than  what  can  be  achieved  right  now  by  any  other  model,  it  
seems.
 the  instrumental  output...  meh.  I  can  hear  vocals  in  it,  on  a  low  volume  level."  but  be  aware  
that
 
improved
 
their
 
model
 
by
 
the
 
time
 
by
 
a
 
lot.
