    1296+1297+MDX23C  HQ  Instead  of  1297  and  for  faster  processing  and  similar  result,  make  a  manual  ensemble  with  a  
copy
 
of
 
1296
 
result
 
instead.
 
It
 
might
 
work
 
in
 
similar
 
fashion
 
like
 
weighting
 
in

Colab
 
and
 model  ensemble  on  MVSEP  (source).   -  VIP  code  allowing  access  to  extra  models  in  UVR  currently  doesn’t  work  using  Roformer  beta  patch older  than  #10,  and  MDX23C  Inst  Voc  HQ  2  models  disappeared  from  download  center  and  GH.  You  can  try  to  download  VIP  model  files  manually  from  this  link  and  place  
them

are
 
not

 Decrypted  VIP  repo  leads  to  links  which  are  offline,  and  also  it  doesn’t  contain  all  models.  
Possibly
 
the
 
only
 
way
 
to
 
access
 
all
 
the
 
VIP
 
models
 
in
 
beta
 
UVR,
 
is
 
to
 
roll
 
back
 
to
 
stable
 
5.6
 
version
 
from
 
UVR
 
official
 
repo,
 
and
 
after
 
downloading
 
all
 
desired
 
VIP
 
models,
 
update
 
to
 
the
 
latest
 
patch.
  -  According  to  their  forum  leak,  iZotope  RX11  might  be  released  between  May  and  July,  and  
contain
 
some
 
“pretty
 
big
 
changes”,
 
among
 
others,
 
a
 
novel
 
arch
 
for
 
separation
 
is
 
rumored,
 
and
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
options
 
reworked.
