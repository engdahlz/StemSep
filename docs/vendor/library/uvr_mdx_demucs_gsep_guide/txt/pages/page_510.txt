    fragment  with  e.g.  lossless-cut  in  order  to  avoid  reencoding.  It  can  work  even  more  efficiently  
that
 
way.
  Sometimes  I  use  Matchering  for  different  master  versions  of  the  same  song  when  I  have  a  
few
 
masters
 
I
 
like
 
certain
 
things
 
in
 
them,
 
but
 
none
 
good
 
enough
 
on
 
their
 
own.
 Usually,  in  the  target  file  should  be  placed  the  file  with  the  richest  spectrum  (but  feel  free  to  
experiment).
 Can  be  a  target  file  e.g.  after  a  lot  of  spectral  restoration,  which  e.g.  lost  some  warm  and  
fidelity,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
something
 
from
 
the
 
previous
 
master
 
version.
 You  can  also  try  to  reprocess  your  result  up  to  even  6  times,  inputting  a  new  file  in  target  or  
reference
 
each
 
time,
 
till
 
you’ll
 
find
 
the
 
best
 
result.
 
But
 
usually
 
2-3
 
should
 
do
 
the
 
trick,
 
sometimes
 
while
 
using
 
target
 
and
 
reference
 
interchangeably
 
for
 
different
 
result
 
files.
 For  using  Matchering  in  UVR5,  necessarily  check  the  option  “Settings  Test  Mode”  in  
additional
 
settings.
 
It
 
will
 
add
 
a
 
10
 
digits
 
number
 
to
 
each
 
result,
 
preventing
 
you
 
from
 
overwriting
 
your
 
old
 
files
 
during
 
multiple
 
experiments
 
conducted
 
on
 
your
 
files.
 
UVR
 
doesn’t
 
ask
 
before
 
overwriting!
 Feel  free  to  experiment  with  WAV  output  quality.  Probably  the  further  you’ll  go  from  24  bit,  
the
 
more
 
different
 
your
 
result
 
will
 
be
 
after
 
converting
 
back
 
to
 
16
 
bit
 
by
 
some
 
lossy
 
codec
 
like
 
Opus
 
on
 
YT.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
care
 
mostly
 
about
 
the
 
result
 
file,
 
then
 
simply
 
be
 
aware
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
output
 
quality
 
to
 
your
 
advantage,
 
knowing
 
in
 
what
 
way
 
specific
 
bit
 
depth
 
affects
 
output
 
results.
 
E.g.
 
the
 
muddier
 
results
 
start
 
with
 
PCM_32
 
(non-float),
 
64
 
bit
 
has
 
it
 
too,
 
but
 
additionally
 
with
 
some
 
grittiness.
 
16
 
bit
 
is
 
usually
 
good
 
to
 
glue
 
well
 
sounding
 
audio
 
together
 
with
 
loudly
 
sounding
 
snares
 
already,
 
but
 
can
 
be
 
muddy
 
frequently
 
or
 
harsher
 
than
 
e.g.
 
32
 
bit
 
non-float.
 
Usually
 
your
 
result
 
will
 
be
 
not
 
so
 
good
 
in
 
most
 
cases,
 
hence
 
I’d
 
encourage
 
using
 
higher
 
bit
 
depths
 
than
 
16
 
bit
 
here,
 
but
 
24
 
bit
 
can
 
make
 
your
 
audio
 
too
 
bright
 
at
 
times,
 
hence
 
in
 
such
 
cases
 
you
 
can
 
check
 
32
 
bit
 
float
 
and
 
non-float.
 
There’s
 
no
 
simple
 
setting
 
working
 
for
 
every
 
song,
 
but
 
the
 
most
 
universal
 
setting
 
I
 
found
 
so
 
far
 
is
 
using
 
non-float
 
32
 
bit
 
and
 
convert
 
it
 
to
 
16-bit
 
manually.
 
It’s
 
the
 
most
 
balanced
 
setting
 
across
 
the
 
whole
 
song
 
(might
 
be
 
slightly
 
too
 
muddy
 
at
 
times).
 Sometimes  it  can  be  good  to  have  the  richest  file  on  a  spectrogram  as  a  target  file,  as  it  
won’t
 
be
 
lost
 
after
 
processing.
 Matchering  can  be  generally  useful  when  you  have  different  versions  of  your  masters,  and  
you’re
 
running
 
in
 
circles
 
finding
 
the
 
best
 
one.
 
Then
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
such
 
different
 
versions
 
as
 
target
 
and
 
reference
 
(or
 
in
 
reverse),
 
check
 
what
 
sounds
 
the
 
best,
 
get
 
the
 
result,
 
use
 
in
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
fields,
 
retry,
 
and
 
the
 
same
 
up
 
to
 
4
 
times
 
till
 
it
 
sounds
 
the
 
best.
 
Then
 
you
 
could
 
potentially
 
master
 
it
 
further
 
and/or
 
separate
 
into
 
stems
 
and
 
bring
 
the
 
session
 
back
 
from
 
this
 
place.
  If  you  need  more  customizable  settings  for  Matchering,  e.g.  controlling  limiter  intensity,  or  disabling  it  completely,  consider  using  ComfyUI-Matchering (standalone/portable  ComfyUI  package  for  CPU  or  Nvidia:  new_ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu124_or_cpu)    .masterknecht  https://masterknecht.klangknecht.com/
