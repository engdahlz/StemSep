[page 102/642]
    For  MDX23C,  when  trained  with  ~6sec  chunks,  iirc,  peak  SDR  value  was  around  24  sec  
chunks
 
(I
 
think
 
it
 
was
 
same
 
for
 
vit_large,
 
you
 
could
 
make
 
chunks
 
4
 
times
 
longer)
 How  much  chunk_size  can  be  extended  during  inference  seems  to  be  arch  dependant.”  -

  Changelog  #10:  Added  SCNet  and  Bandit  archs  with  models  in  Download  Center,  fixed  compatibility  with  
some
 
newer
 
Roformer
 
models
 
(prob.
 
the
 
Phantom
 
center
 
and
 
400MB
 
small
 
Unwa
 
models,
 
not
 
sure
 
yet),
 
new
 
Model
 
Installer
 
option
 
added,
 
model
 
configuration
 
menu
 
enhanced,
 
allowing
 
aliases
 
to
 
selected
 
models,
 
added
 
compatibility
 
for
 
Roformer/MDX23C
 
Karaoke
 
models
 
with
 
the
 
vocal
 
splitter,
 
VIP
 
code
 
issue
 
is
 
gone,
 
issues
 
with
 
secondary
 
models
 
options
 
and
 
minor
 
bugs
 
and
 
interface
 
annoyances
 
are
 
addressed,
 
“improved
 
the
 
"Change
 
Model
 
Settings"
 
menu.
 
Now,
 
any
 
existing
 
settings
 
associated
 
with
 
a
 
selected
 
model
 
are
 
automatically
 
populated,
 
making
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
users
 
to
 
review
 
and
 
adjust
 
settings
 
(previously,
 
these
 
settings
 
were
 
not
 
visible
 
even
 
if
 
applied).”.
 “Unfortunately,  SCnet  is  not  compatible  with  DirectML,  so  AMD  GPU  users  will  have  to  use  
the
 
CPU
 
for
 
those
 
models.
 Bandit  models  are  not  compatible  with  MPS  or  DirectML.  For  those  with  AMD  GPU's  and  
Apple
 
Silicon,
 
those
 
will
 
be
 
CPU
 
only.
 The  good  news  is  those  models  aren't  all  that  slow  on  CPU.”  -  Anjok   
Changelog
 
#9:
 Apollo  fixes:  “Chunk  sizes  can  now  be  set  to  lower  values  (between  1-6)  Overlap  can  be  turned  off  (set  to  0)”  Fix  both  for  Apollo  and  Roformers:  now  5  seconds  or  shorter  input  files  no  longer  cause  
errors.
 OpenCL  was  wrongly  referenced  in  the  UVR.  It  was  actually  DirectML  all  the  way,  and  Anjok  
changed
 
all
 
the
 
OpenCL
 
names
 
in
 
the
 
app
 
into
 
DirectML.
  Changelog  for  all  platforms:  
Patch
 
#3
 
fixed
 
the
 
issue
 
with
 
stem
 
misalignment
 
when
 
using
 
incorrect
 
overlap
 
setting
 
for
 
Roformers.
 
Now
 
it
 
uses
 
ZFTurbo
 
code
 
(also
 
for
 
MDX23C),
 
meaning
 
that
 
now
 
increasing
 
overlap
 
for
 
Roformers
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
increasing
 
separation
 
times
 
and
 
potentially
 
better
 
SDR
 
[the
 
opposite
 
of
 
what
 
it
 
used
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
beta
 
Roformer
 
patches
 
#1
 
and
 
#2].
 
Also,
 
it
 
“Fixed
 
manual
 
download
 
link
 
issues
 
in
 
the
 
Download
 
Center.
 
Roformer
 
models
 
can
 
now
 
be
 
downloaded
 
without
 
issue.”).
 
Also,
 
new
 
Roformer
 
models
 
were
 
added
 
to
 
Download
 
Center,
 
so
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
download
 
them
 
manually.
  -  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #8  for  Win:  full |  patch |  Mac:  M1 |  x86-64:  UVR_Patch_12_3_24_1_18_BETA  
Apollo
 
arch
 
was
 
made
 
compatible
 
with
 
OpenCL
 
too,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
unstable
 
and
 
very
 
RAM
 
intensive
 
-
 
use
 
chunk
 
size
 
over
 
7
 
to
 
prevent
 
errors
 
(currently
 
it’s
 
not
 
certain
 
that
 
all
 
models
 
will
 
work
 
with
 
less
 
than
 
12GB
 
of
 
VRAM).
 
At
 
least
 
in
 
newer
 
patches,
 
it
 
can
 
straight
 
up
 
say
 
that
 
Apollo
 
is
 
not
 
compatible
 
with
 
DirectML,
 
and
 
fall
 
back
 
to
 
CPU
 
mode.
