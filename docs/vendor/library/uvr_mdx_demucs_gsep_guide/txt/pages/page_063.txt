ZFTurbo
 
released
 
new
 
models
 
on
 
MVSEP:
 
a)
 
a
 
new
 
Male/Female
 
separation
 
model
 
based
 
on
 
SCNet
 
XL
 SDR  on  the  same  dataset:  11.8346  vs  6.5259  (Sucial)  
Model
 
only
 
works
 
on
 
vocals.
 
If
 
the
 
track
 
contains
 
music,
 
use
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
"extract
 
vocals"
 
first.
 
Sometimes
 
the
 
old
 
Sucial
 
model
 
might
 
still
 
do
 
a
 
better
 
job
 
at
 
times,
 
so
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
experiment.
  b)  SCNet  XL  (vocals,  instum)  Inst  SDR:  17.2785  Vocals  have  similar  SDR  to  viperx  1297  model,   and  instrumental  has  a  tiny  bit  worse  score  vs  Mel-Kim  model.  -  “All  Ensembles  on  MVSep  were  updated  with  latest  release  [SCNet  XL]  increasing  vocals  
SDR
 
to
 
11.50
 
->
 
11.61
 
and
 
instrum
 
SDR:
 
17.81
 
->
 
17.92”.

(hendry.setiadi)
 The  instrumental  model  pulled  out  more  adlibs  than  the  released  vocal  model  variant  -  it  
pulled
 
out
 
nothing
 
(isling).
 
“Vocal
 
model

almost

screams
 
effortlessly.
 
Wow,
 
I've
 
NEVER
 
heard
 
that
 
scream
 
so
 
cleanly”

The
 
model
 
was
 
trained
 
on
 
dataset
 
type
 
2
 
and
 
single
 
RTX
 
3090
 
for
 
two
 
days
 
(although
 
with
 
months
 
of
 
experimentation
 
beforehand).
 
SDR
 
metrics
 
are
 
lower
 
than
 
Mel-Kim
 
model.
 If  you  use  lower  dim_t  like  256  at  the  bottom  of  config  for  slower  GPU,  these  are  the  first  
models
 
to
 
have
 
very
 
bad
 
results
 
with
 
that
 
setting.
