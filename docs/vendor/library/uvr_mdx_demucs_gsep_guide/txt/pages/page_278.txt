    model,  but  I  cannot  guarantee  that  Min  Spec  in  UVR  and  manual  ensemble  will  necessarily  
work
 
exactly
 
like
 
Min
 
Mag
 
in
 
Colab
 
for
 
a
 
single
 
model.
 
But
 
the
 
explanation
 
remains
 
the
 
same.
 
The
 
best
 
option
 
might
 
even
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song.
  TL;DR  For  vocals  bleeding  in  instrumentals   You  can  use  Spectral  Inversion  for  alleviating  problems  with  bleeding  in  instrumentals.  Max  Spec/Min  Spec  is  also  useful  in  such  scenario.   You  want  less  bleed  of  Vocal  in  Instrumental  stem?  Use  Max-Min   For  bleeding  instruments  in  vocals   Phase  Inversion  enabled  helps  to  get  rid  of  transients  of  the  kick  which  might  be  still  
hearable
 
in
 
vocals
 
in
 
some
 
cases.
  Set  Ensemble  Algorithm:  Min/Avg  when  you  still  hear  bleeding.   If  still  the  same,  try  Min/Max  instead  of  Avg/Avg  when  doing  an  ensemble  with  
Vocals/Instrumental
 
output.
  Also,  you  can  resign  from  ensemble  setting,  and  simply  use  only  one  clean  model  on  the  
models
 
list
 
if
 
the
 
result
 
is
 
still
 
not
 
satisfactory.
   Further  explanations   
Why
 
not
 
always
 
go
 
for
 
Min-Max
 
when
 
you
 
want
 
the
 
best
 
acapella?
 Why  not  always  go  for  Max-Min  when  you  want  the  best  Instrumental?   So  far,  I  hear  Max-Min  on  Instrumental  sounds  more  'muddy/muffled'  compared  to  Avg-Avg.  I  bet  this  will  be  the  same  for  acapella,  but  it's  less  noticeable  (I  don't  hear  it).   Hence,  I  think  the  best  approach  would  be  always  going  with  Avg-Avg.  Then  based  on  the  outcome  -  after  reviewing,  tweak  it  based  on  your  desired  outcome,  and  process  again  with  either  Min-Max  or  Max-Min.”   Min  =  less  bleeding  of  the  other  side/stem  (into  this  side/stem),  but  could  get  sound  
muddy/muffled
 Max  =  more  full  sound,  but  potential  it  will  have  more  bleeding  Avg  =  average,  so  a  bit  of  all  models  combined
