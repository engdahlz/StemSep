    And  for  HF,  follow  the  pattern  presented  in  the  Colab  example  (so  with  the  resolve  in  the  file  
address)
  -  model_fusion.py by  Sucial  This  script  seems  to  save  the  weighted  ensemble  of  three  models  into  a  checkpoint  called  
"fused".
 
The
 
result
 
is
 
not
 
bigger
 
than
 
a
 
single
 
model.
 Probably  you  could  basically  create  one  checkpoint  getting  the  same  or  similar  results  of  
manually
 
weighted
 
models,
 
and
 
not
 
inference
 
every
 
of
 
them
 
one
 
by
 
one.
