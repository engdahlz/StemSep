[page 434/642]
     The  phase  inversion  denoise  trick  (was  already  in  original  code  from  ZFTurbo,  also  used  in  
UVR):
 Some  archs  (MDXv2  mostly,  so  VOC-FT  here)  are  adding  noise  to  output  signals.  So  to  
attenuate
 
it,
 
we
 
process
 
the
 
input
 
2
 
times,
 
including
 
one
 
time
 
with
 
phase
 
polarity
 
inverted
 
before
 
processing,
 
and
 
restored
 
after
 
processing.
 
So,
 
only
 
the
 
model
 
noise
 
is
 
phase
 
cancelled
 
when
 
the
 
2
 
passes
 
are
 
mixed
 
together.
 
(It
 
doesn't
 
cancel
 
100%,
 
but
 
it's
 
attenuated).
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
applied
 
to
 
Demucs
 
processing
 
(since
 
original
 
code).
 MDXv3  &  VitLarge  don't  seem  to  add  noise  (or  at  insignificant  volume)  so  this  trick  is  not  
used
 
with
 
these
 
models.
  Segment_size  (dim_t)  original  model  value  is  doubled  since  v2.3  of  the  fork.  Some  benchmarks  done  by  Bas  Curtiz  showed  that  it  gives  a  little  bit  better  results  (here with  VOC-FT,  there's  the  same  benchmark  with  InstVocHQ  model  here).   Multiband  ensembling:  I'm  using  a  2-band  ensemble,  with  different  ensemble  in  frequencies  below  10  kHz  and  
above.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
workaround
 
to
 
get
 
fullband
 
final
 
results
 
even
 
when
 
not
 
fullband
 
models
 
are
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
ensemble
 
(like
 
VOC-FT).
 
Without
 
it,
 
the
 
instrumental
 
stem,
 
obtained
 
by
 
vocals
 
phase
 
inversion
 
against
 
the
 
input
 
audio
 
would
 
have
 
small
 
permanent
 
vocals
 
bleeding
 
above
 
VOC-FT's
 
cutoff,
 
as
 
phase
 
cancellation
 
would
 
be
 
biased
 
there.
 It  was  a  really  more  essential  feature  in  previous  versions  when  most  of  the  models  were  not  
fullband.
 VitLarge  is  not  used  too  in  high  freq  band,  but  it's  a  more  personal  taste  (so  in  the  end  
there's
 
only
 
InstVoc
 
model
 
results
 
above
 
the
 
crossover
 
region)
  In  fact,  alternatively  you  could  separate  your  instrumental  with  Demucs  single  models  used  
by
 
the
 
Colab
 
(demucs_ft,
 
demucs
 
6s,
 
demucs,
 
mmi)
 
and
 
use
 
SCNet
 
XL
 
and
 
BS-Roformer
 models  from  here.  As,  along  with  demucs_ft,  they  have  the  best  overall  SDR  for  4  stems  separation  (actually  
MDX23C
 
model1
 
can
 
give
 
interesting
 
results
 
too
 
compared
 
to
 
demucs_ft).
 And  then  perform  manual  weighted  ensemble  in  DAW  by  setting  volume  of  the  stems  
manually
 
to
 
your
 
liking
 
after
 
importing
 
and
 
aligning
 
lossless
 
stems.
 
 Because  rarely  ensembling  of  more  than  4  stems  gives  good  results,  IG  you  could  get  rid  of  
some
 
demucs
 
models
 
with
 
lower
 
SDR
 
for
 
it
 
(I
 
think
 
the
 
mmi
 
has
 
the
 
lowest
 
SDR,
 
and
 
then
 
6s).
 If  it's  too  much  of  a  hassle,  you  could  change  the  volume  of  the  stems  from  a  specific  model  
by
 
the
 
same
 
volume.
