 (for  even  better  fullness  but  more  noise  -  you  can  consider  the  phase  fix for  instv1)   -  Anjok  released  a  new  beta  Roformer  patch #5  for  UVR  (Windows  only):  UVR_Patch_UVR_11_17_24_21_4_BETA_patch_roformer  “-  Fixed  OpenCL  compatibility  issue  with  Roformer  &  MDX23C  models.  -  Fixed  stem  swap  issue  with  Roformer  instrumental  models  in  Ensemble  Mode.”  The  patch  is  rather  not  standalone  like  patch  #3,  so  have  a  previous  UVR  installation.   -  Anjok  released  a  new  beta  Roformer  patch  #4  for  UVR:  UVR_Patch_11_17_24_21_4_BETA  (Windows:  full |  patch |  Mac:  M1 |  x86-64)  Minor  bug  fixes.  Most  importantly,  MacOS  version  fix:  “Roformer  checkbox  now  visible  for  unrecognized  Roformer  models”  so  now  you  can  use  
custom
 
Roformer
 
models
 
on
 
MacOS
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
without
 
copying/modifying
 
configuration
 
files
 
from
 
Windows
 
version
 
or
 
other
 
users
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
circumvent
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
option
 
from
 
Windows
 
version
 
to
 
set
 
that
 
the
 
recognized
 
model
 
is
 
Roformer,
 
so
 
separation
 
will
 
work
 
on
 
that
 
model.
 
Plus
 
it
 
includes
 
all
 
the
 
previous
 
fixes
 
in
 
the
 
previously
 
released
 
patch
 
(so
 
overlap
 
code
 
fixed,
 
so
 
no
 
stem
 
misalignment
 
should
 
occur
 
on
 
certain
 
overlap
 
settings
 
-
 
probably
 
higher
 
overlap
 
now
 
means
 
longer
 
separation)
  -  Anjok  released  a  new  beta  Roformer  patch  #3  for  UVR  (Windows  version  for  now)  UVR_Patch_11_14_24_20_21_BETA_patch_roformer -   “this  is  a  patch  and  requires  an  existing  UVR  installation”  (so  either  previous beta  Roformer  patch  or  stable  5.6  version).  The  new  patch  fixes  the  issue  with  stem  misalignment  when  using  incorrect  overlap  setting  
for
 
Roformers.
 
Now
 
it
 
uses
 
ZFTurbo
 
code
 
(also
 
for
 
MDX23C),
 
meaning
 
that
 
probably
 
now
 
increasing
 
overlap
 
for
 
Roformers
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
increasing
 
separation
 
times
 
and
 
potentially
 
better
 
SDR
 
(the
 
opposite
 
of
 
what
 
it
 
used
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
beta
 
Roformer
 
patch).
 
Potentially,
 
it
 
might
 
allow
 
using
 
faster
 
settings
 
without
 
stem
 
misalignments
 
or
 
segment
 
popping
 
(when
 
overlap
 
and
 
dim_t
 
was
 
set
 
to
 
201
 
and
 
overlap
 
2)
 
for
 
4GB
 
VRAM
 
cards
 
and
 
some
 
heavier
 
models.

other
 
minor
