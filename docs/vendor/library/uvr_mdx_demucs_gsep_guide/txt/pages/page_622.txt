    Universal  function  to  make  different  types  of  ensembles  by  ZFTurbo  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911050124661227542/1192220574982881320/ensemble.py I  think  it’s  the  same  or  newer:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/blob/main/ensemble.py  “In  my  experiments  SDR  for  avg_wave  always  the  max.”   Now  also  jarredou  made  his  Colab  with  the  above  implemented  with  comfy  GUI:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/jarredou/Music-Source-Separation-Training-Colab-Inference/blob/main/Manual_Ensemble_Colab.ipynb  _____________________________________________________    ____________________________________________________________________   
Volume  compensation  for  MDX  v2  models   How  to  automate  calculation  of  volume  compensation  value  for  all  older  MDX  models  (results  are  not  perfect  and  need  to  be  fine-tuned)   by  jarredou   So,  I  have  maybe  a  protocol  to  find  accurate  volume  compensation:   -  Use  a  short  .wav  file  of  just  noise  (I've  used  pink  noise  here)  and  pass  it  through  the  model  
you
 
wanna
 
evaluate
  -  Take  the  resulting  audio,  the  one  that  will  have  all  the  noise  in  it  and  compare  it  to  the  
original
 
noise
 
with
 
this
 
little
 
python
 
script
 
that
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
the
 
difference
 
in
 
dBTP
 
and
 
the
 
quivalent
 
VC
 
ratio
 
(you'll
 
need
 
to
 
 pip  install  librosa   if  you  don't  have  it  installed  already).  The  results  I've  found  with  it  are  coherent  with  the  
ones
 
you've
 
found
 
by
 
ears
 
!
