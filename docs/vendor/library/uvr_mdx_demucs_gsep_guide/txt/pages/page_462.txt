VirtualDJ  2023/Stems  2.0  (kick,  hi-hat)  Probably  using  drums  from  Demucs  4  or  GSEP  first,  will  give  better  results  but,  it's  not  
perfect.
 
In
 
many
 
cases
 
it
 
may
 
leave
 
bleeding
 
of
 
snare
 
a
 
little
 
bit,
 
in
 
both
 
hi-hat
 
and
 
kick
 
track.
 
Sadly
 
it
 
sometimes
 
confuses
 
these
 
elements
 
of
 
a
 
mix.
   "If  you  are  not  using  it  professionally,  and  do  not  use  any  professional  equipment  like  a  DJ  
controller,
 
or
 
a
 
DJ
 
mixer,
 
then
 
VirtualDJ
 
is
 
(now)
 
FREE".
 
RipX  DeepAudio  (-||-)  (6  stems  [piano,  guitar])  Popular  tool.  Decent  results  for  specific  drums'  sections  separation  (but  as  for  
vocal/instrumental/4
 
stems
 
separation,
 
all
 
the
 
tools
 
mentioned
 
in
 
at
 
the
 
very
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
document
 
outperforms
 
RipX,
 
so
 
use
 
it
 
only
 
for
 
specific
 
drums’
 
section
 
separation
 
only,
 
at
 
best
 
using
 
Demucs
 
4
 
or
 
GSEP
 
for
 
drums
 
stem).
 
  "It  can  separate  a  file  into  a  buncha  things  into  a  lot  more  types  of  instruments  than  just  the  
basic
 
4
 
stems
 
(with
 
varying
 
degrees
 
of
 
success
 
ofc).
  Might  be  a  case  that  old  cracked  versions  of  RipX  don't  allow  separating  drums  sections  
well,
 
or
 
just
 
the
 
opposite
 
-
 
check
 
both
 
the
 
newest
 
version
 
and
 
Hit'n'Mix
 
RipX
 
DeepAudio
 
v5.2.6,
 
but
 
probably
 
the
 
latter
 
doesn't
 
support
 
separating
 
single
 
drums
 
yet.
 
  It’s  basically  UVR  but  with  their  custom  models  +  SFX  single  stem   It's  good  for  guitar,  but  not  in  all  cases  (possibly  Demucs  for  4  stems).  Piano  and  guitar  models  were  added  recently  (somewhere  in  the  January  2023)   -  Hit  'n'  Mix  RipX  DAW  Pro  7  released.  For  GPU  acceleration,  min.  requirement  is  8GB  
VRAM
 
and
 
10XX
 
card
 
or
 
newer
 
(mentioned
 
by
 
the
 
official
 
document
 
are:
 
1070,
 
1080,
 
2070,
 
2080,
 
3070,
 
3080,
 
3090,
 
40XX).
 
Additionally,
 
for
 
GPU
 
acceleration
 
to
 
work,
 
exactly
 
Nvidia
 
CUDA
 
Toolkit
 
v.11.0
 
is
 
necessary.
 
Occasionally
 
during
 
transition
 
from
 
some
 
older
 
versions,
 
separation
 
quality
 
of
 
harmonies
 
can
 
increase.
 
Separation
 
time
 
with
 
GPU
 
acceleration
 
can
 
decrease
 
from
 
even
 
40
 
minutes
 
on
 
CPU
 
to
 
2
 
minutes
 
on
 
decent
 
GPU.
  They  say  it  uses  Demucs.   We  have  reports  about  crashes,  at  least  on  certain  audio  files.  There  are  various  RipX  
versions
 
uploaded
 
on
 
archive.org,
 
maybe
 
one
 
will
 
work,
 
but
 
some
 
keys
 
work
 
only
 
on
 
versions
 
from
 
2
 
and
 
up.
 
Spectralayers  10  Received  an  update  of  an  AI,  and  they  no  longer  use  Spleeter,  but  Demucs  4  (6s),  and  they  
now
 
also
 
good
 
kick,
 
snare,
 
cymbals
 
separation
 
too.
 
Good
 
opinions
 
so
 
far.
