 VS  v1e  ”it  seems  to  pick  up  some  instruments  better”  Gabox  “a  bit  cleaner-sounding  and  has  less  filtering/watery  artifacts.   Both  models  are  prone  to  very  strange  vocal  leakage  [“especially  in  the  chorus.”].   And  because  Fv8  can  be  so  clean  at  times,  the  leakage  can  be  fairly  obvious.  For  now,  my  
vote
 
is
 
for
 
Fv8,
 
but
 
I'll
 
still
 
probably
 
be
 
switching
 
back
 
and
 
forth
 
a
 
lot”

multilingual
 model  to  inference  Colab  -  Unwa  released  a  new  V1e+  Mel-Roformer  instrumental  model |  yaml |  Colab Inst  bleedless:  36.53,  fullness:  37.89,  SDR:  16.65   Less  noise  than  v1e  (esp.  in  the  lower  frequencies),  but  it’s  also  less  full  -  “somewhere  
between
 
v1
 
and
 
v1e.”.
 
It
 
has
 
fewer
 
problems
 
with
 
quiet
 
vocals
 
in
 
instrumentals
 
than
 
the
 
V1+,
 
“issues
 
with
 
harmonica,
 
saxophone,
 
elec
 
guitar
 
and
 
synth
 
seem
 
to
 
have
 
been
 
fixed.
 
Theremin
 
and
 
kazoo
 
are
 
still
 
problematic
 
[like]
 
for
 
models
 
from
 
MDX-Net
 
or
 
SCNet
 
[archs]).
 
Only
 
dango
 
seems
 
to
 
correctly
 
detect
 
kazoo
 
as
 
an
 
instrument
 
it
 
seems”

 “v1e  keeps  better  instruments  like  trumps  than  v1e+  With  v1e+  there  is  less  noise,  but  some  instruments  are  hidden”  koseidon72  “v1e+  has  a  strange  problem  of  almost  vocoding  the  vocals  and  keeping  them  in  quietly”  
even
 
with

 “has  some  problems  with  cymbals  bleed  in  vocals  (not  the  case  with  other  instrumental  
roformer
 
models)”
 
dca
 “trained  with  additional  phase  loss  which  helps  remove  some  of  that  metallic  fullness  noise,

also
 
has
 
higher

I
 
believe”
