course)”
 
at

when
 
the

it

it's
 
a

Def
 
an
 
improvement
 
over

I'm
 
really
 
liking
 
the
 
balance
 
of
 
fullness
 
and
 
noise
 
for
 
most
 
songs.
 
fv4
 
and
 
fv6/fv7beta1
 
are
 
usually
 
pretty
 
noisy...
 
this
 
is
 
less
 
noisy,
 
but
 
still
 
has
 
a
 
good
 
amount
 
of
 
fullness.”
 
“Where
 
the
 
noise
 
was
 
undesirable
 
and
 
I
 
ensembled
 
fv4/fv6/fv7beta1
 
with
 
big
 
beta
 
6x,
 
now
 
I
 
can
 
just
 
use
 
this
 
instead”.
 “Fv7beta2  has  still  been  significantly  better  with  BV  than  fv4,  despite  quite  a  bit  less  noise”  
but
 
“significant
 
issues
 
on
 
one
 
song,
 
while
 
fv6/fv7beta1
 
didn't”
 
 
“If
 
the
 
noise
 
isn't
 
an
 
issue,
 
and
 
you
 
just
 
want
 
fullness,
 
fv6/fv7beta1
 
are
 
still
 
the
 
best
 
models.
 
I'd
 
say
 
fv6
 
and
 
fv7beta1
 
are
 
better
 
models
 
than
 
fv4,
 
fullness/noise
 
aside.
 
It
 
depends
 
with
 
fv7beta1
 
versus
 
fv7beta2,
 
sometimes
 
the
 
noise
 
can
 
be
 
pretty
 
significant
 
with
 
fv7beta1,
 
and
 
fv7beta2
 
may
 
have
 
the
 
fullness
 
you
 
desire.
 
 fv6  is  usually  more  noisy/full  than  fv7beta1,  but  it  just  depends...  I've  had  instances  where  it's  
less
 
noisy/full
 
than
 
fv7beta1.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
really
 
want
 
high
 
fullness,
 
fv6
 
and
 
fv7beta1
 
are
 
the
 
choices.
 
Sometimes
 
fv6
 
can
 
be
 
quite
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
noisy
 
and
 
the
 
gain
 
in
 
fullness
 
isn't
 
worth
 
it”.
