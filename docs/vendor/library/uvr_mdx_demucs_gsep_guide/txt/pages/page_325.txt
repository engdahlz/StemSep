    as  a  result  of  inversion  have  max  22kHz  frequency  (but  UVR  applies  it  to  prevent  some  
noise).
  -  (generally  outperformed  by  models  above)  MDX-UVR  9.7  vocal  model a.k.a.  UVR-MDX-NET  1  (instrumental  is  done  by  inversion,  older  model)  -  available  in  Google  Colab/mvsep (here  24  bit  for  instrumentals)/UVR5  GUI.  Compared  to  9.682  NET  2  model,  it  might  have  better  results  on  vocals,  where  9.682  NET  
might
 
have
 
better
 
results
 
for
 
instrumentals,
 
but
 
everything
 
might
 
still
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song.
 
Generally,
 
9.7
 
model
 
got
 
better
 
SDR
 
both
 
in
 
Sony
 
Demixing
 
Challenge
 
and
 
on
 
MVSEP.
 
Generally,
 
438
 
vocal,
 
or
 
464
 
inst_3
 
should
 
give
 
better
 
results
 
for
 
instrumentals.
 
427
 
vocal
 
model
 
tends
 
to
 
give
 
worse
 
results
 
for
 
instrumentals
 
than
 
even
 
this
 
older
 
9.7/NET1
 
model.
  More  about  MDX-UVR  models  -   If  they  don't  have  more  vocal  bleeding  than  GSEP,  they’re  better  in  filtering  more  vocal  
leftovers
 
which
 
sometimes
 
GSEP
 
tend
 
to
 
leave
 
(scratches,
 
additional
 
vocal
 
sounding
 
sounds,
 
also
 
so-called
 
“cuts”
 
[short
 
multiple
 
lo-fi
 
vocal
 
parts]
 
which
 
GSEP
 
doesn’t
 
catch,
 
but
 
MDX-UVR
 
does
 
probably
 
due
 
to
 
bigger
 
dataset).
 
But
 
using
 
single
 
instrumental
 
MDX-UVR
 
models
 
instead
 
of
 
ensemble
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
cut
 
off
 
of
 
a
 
training
 
frequency
 
(e.g.
 
17.7kHz
 
or
 
lower).
 Also,  MDX-UVR  like  GSEP  may  not  have  this  weird  constant  "fuzz"  which  VR  models  tend  to  
leave
 
as
 
vocal
 
leftovers
 
(but
 
in
 
other
 
cases,
 
9.7
 
model
 
can
 
leave
 
very
 
audible
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
so
 
test
 
out
 
everything
 
on
 
this
 
list,
 
till
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
best
 
result).
 The  9.7  model  (or  currently  newer  models)  is  also  good  for  cleaning  inverts  (e.g.  when  
having
 
lossy
 
a
 
cappella
 
and
 
regular
 
song).
  If  you  tested  all  the  alternatives,  and  you  stick  to  the  MDX-UVR  9.7  for  some  song,  and  it  
doesn't
 
have
 
(too
 
much)
 
bleeding,
 
to
 
fine-tune
 
the
 
results
 
you
 
can
 
try
 
out
 
two
 
9.6
 
models
 
to
 
check
 
whether
 
it's
 
better
 
for
 
you
 
than
 
9.7
 
in
 
this
 
specific
 
case
 
(they're
 
available
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
HV
 
Colab
 
and
 
UVR5
 
GUI).
 Newer  MDX-UVR  423  vocal  model  usually  provides  more  audible  leftovers  than  9.7  model.   To  further  experiment  with  MDX-UVR  results,  and  you’re  stuck  with  Colab,  you  can  enable  
Demucs
 
2
 
model
 
on
 
Colab
 
to
 
"ensemble"
 
it
 
with
 
MDX-UVR
 
model
 
(although
 
metrics
 
say
 
it
 
slightly
 
decreases
 
SDR,
 
I
 
like
 
what
 
it
 
does
 
in
 
hi-end
 
-
 
it
 
was
 
suspected
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
the
 
SDR
 
decreasing
 
problems
 
may
 
come
 
out
 
from
 
enabling
 
chunking).
 
 ________________   -  Demucs  4 (htdemucs_ft)  -  no  cutoff,  it’s  4  stem,  but  you  can  perform  mixdown  without  vocals  in  Audacity  for  instrumental  -  sometimes  it  may  give  you  louder  snare  than  in  GSEP,  
but
 
usually
 
muffled
 
shakers
 
compared
 
to
 
GSEP.
 
Also,
 
it
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
GSEP
 
and
 
MDX-UVR
 
464
 
(Inst
 
3).
