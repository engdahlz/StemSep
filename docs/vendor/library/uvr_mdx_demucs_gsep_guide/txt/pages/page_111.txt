    “”’norm’””  attributeError  using  e.g.  unwa  beta  5e  model  in  UVR  -  a)  Ensure  you  installed  UVR  Roformer  patch (5.6.1),  and  you're  not  using  the  old  5.6  version  (but  5.6.1  is  reported  once  you  open  the  app)   b)  You  could  pick  wrong  model  architecture  in  Install  model  option  (so  not  Roformer,  and  
generally
 
v1),
 
or
 
haven’t
 
turned
 
on
 
“Roformer
 
model”
 
option
 
during
 
importing
 
the
 
model
 
into
 
UVR
 
(option
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
older
 
beta
 
versions)
  c)  Or  “Edit  the  yaml  file  [of  the  model]  from  this  -   training:    instruments:    -  vocals    -  other    target_instrument:  vocals    use_amp:  True    to  this  -    training:    instruments:    -  Vocals    -  Instrumental    target_instrument:  Vocals    use_amp:  True”  -  Anjok  
 More troubleshooting  on  the  “norm”  issue   E.g.  BS-Roformer_LargeV1  is  stuck  on  5% 
 -  Decrease  chunk_size  to  112455  (new  patches)  
(pre-10#
 
patches)
 
“Go
 
to
 
MDX
 
settings,
 
MX23C
 
specific,
 
turn
 
off
 
default
 
segment
 
size
 
and
 
use
 
segment
 
size
 
256,
 
it's
 
probably
 
filling
 
up
 
your
 
VRAM”
 
The
 
setting
 
resets
 
itself.
 
You
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
set
 
it
 
permanently
 
in
 
the
 
yaml
 
configuration
 
file
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
at
 
the
 
bottom
 
(dim_t
 
parameter).
 
 
It
 
might
 
be
 
required
 
for
 
AMD/Intel
 
4GB
 
VRAM
 
GPUs
 
(or
 
potentially
 
even
 
201,
 
although
 
it
 
was
 
using
 
Rofo
 
patch
 
#2).
  Q:  “is  there  a  way  to  reset  which  yaml  file  to  use?  I  chose  the  incorrect  yaml  file  for  a  
particular
 
ckpt
 
file,
 
and
 
now
 
I
 
cannot
 
change
 
it”
 A:  Go  to  models  list>Edit  Model  Config>Change  parameters  and  choose  the  yaml  from  the  
list.
 Or  go  to  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\MDX_Net_Models\model_data  and  if  it  was  done  
just
 
now,
 
the
 
last
 
modified
 
yaml
 
in
 
this
 
folder
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
one
 
corresponding
 
to
 
your
 
model.
