    It's  not  a  final  model  yet,  the  model  was  in  training  since  April.  It  seems  to  be  muddier  than  HQ_4  (and  more  than  Kim’s  and  MVSEP’s  Mel-Roformer),  it  
has
 
less
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
than
 
before,
 
but
 
more
 
than
 
Kim
 
Mel-Roformer.
 "Almost  perfectly  placed  all  the  guitar  in  the  vocal  stem"  it  might  get  potentially  fixed  in  the  
final
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
model.
  0e)  Other  single  MDX23C  full  band  models  on  mvsep.com (queues  for  free  unregistered  users  can  be  long)  (SDR  is  better  when  three  or  more  of  these  models  are  ensembled  on  MVSEP;  alternatively  in  UVR  5

the

   -  BS-Roformer  model  ver.  2024.04.04  on  MVSEP  (further  trained  from  viperx’  checkpoint  on  
a
 
different
 
dataset).
 
SDR
 
vocals:
 
11.24,
 
instrumental:
 
17.55
 
(vs
 
17.17
 
in
 
the
 
base
 
viperx
 
model).
 
Bad
 
on
 
sax.
 
Less
 
muddy
 
than
 
the
 
three
 
below.
 Though,  all  might  share  same  advantages  and  problems  (filtered  results,  muddiness,  but  the  
least
 
of
 
residues)
  -  Mel-Roformer  model  ver.  2024.08.15  on  MVSEP  (fine-tuned  on  prob.  Kim’s  model)   -  BS-Roformer  12xx  models  by  viperx  model  in  UVR  beta/MVSEP  and  x-minus  (struggles  with  saxophone  too,  but  less  (also  vs  Gabox  inst  v6),  also  struggles  with  some  Arabic  
guitars,
 
bad
 
on
 
vocoders)
 “does  NOT  pick  up  on  large  screams  that  much  (example  being  Shed  by  Meshuggah  in  my  
tests),
 
well
 
at
 
least
 
[vs]
 
[kim’s]
 
x-minus
 
mel-rofo”
 1297  variant  is  being  used  on  x-minus.  It  tends  to  be  better  for  instrumentals  than  the  1296  
model.
  -  Older  BS-Roformer  v2  model  on  MVSEP  (2024.02)  (a  bit  lower  SDR)   All  vocal  Roformer  models  may  sound  clean,  but  filtered  at  the  same  time  -  a  bit  artificial  [it  
tends
 
to
 
be
 
characteristic
 
of
 
the
 
arch],
 
but
 
great
 
for
 
instrumentals
 
with
 
heavy
 
compressed
 
vocals
 
and
 
no
 
bass
 
and
 
drums
 
-
 
the
 
least
 
amount
 
of
 
residues
 
and
 
noise
 
-
 
very
 
aggressive.
  -  old  MelBand  Roformer  model  on  MVSEP  (don’t  confuse  with  the  Kim’s  one  x-minus  -  they’re  
different)
  -  GSEP (now  paid)  -   Inst  fullness:  28.83,  bleedless:  31.18,  SDR:  12.59  Check  out  also  4-6  stem  separation  option  and  perform  mixdown  for  instrumental  manually,  as  it  can  
contain
 
less
 
noise/residues
 
vs
 
2
 
stem
 
in
 
light
 
mix
 
without
 
bass
 
and
 
drums
 
too
 
(although
 
more
 
than
 
first
 
vocal
 
fine-tunes
 
of
 
like
 
MVSEP’s
 
BS-Roformer
 
v2
 
back
 
then).
 
Regular
 
2
 
stem
 
option
 
can
 
be
 
good
 
for
 
e.g.
 
hip-hop,
 
and
 
4/+
 
stems
 
a
 
bit
 
too
 
filtered
 
for
 
instrumentals
 
with
 
busy
 
mix.
 
GSEP
 
tends
 
to
 
preserve
 
flute
 
or
 
similar
 
instruments
 
better
 
than
 
some
 
Roformers
 
and
 
HQ_X
