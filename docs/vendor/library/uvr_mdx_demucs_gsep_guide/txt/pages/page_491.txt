    5b)  Colab  for  downloading  from  Tidal  and  Qobuz  using  your  own  valid  account  (based  on  
streamrip,
 
active
 
subscription
 
required):
 colab.research.google.com/github/r-piratedgames/rip/blob/master/rip.ipynb  6)  For  Deezer  https://archive.org/details/deemix -  it  allows  you  to  download  mp3  320  and  FLAC  files  for  premium  Deezer  accounts,  and  only  mp3  128kbps  for  free  Deezer  accounts.   Be  aware  that  deemix.pro  site  is  unofficial,  and  the  PC  2020  version  linked  there  is  not  
functional.
 
The
 
last
 
2022
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
archive.org
 
linked
 
above
 
from
 
reddit.
 
  Qobuz  or  Deezer  might  give  better  results  since  Tidal  is  recently  deleting  FLAC  support  for  
16
 
bit
 
files
 
on
 
some
 
albums,
 
making
 
all
 
the
 
files
 
16
 
bit
 
MQA,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
fully
 
lossless
 
file
 
format,
 
but
 
close
 
(of
 
course
 
Tidal
 
Downloader
 
converts
 
the
 
same
 
MQA
 
to
 
FLAC).
 
It
 
also
 
provides
 
some
 
high
 
resolution
 
files,
 
but
 
most
 
likely
 
less
 
of
 
them
 
than
 
on
 
Tidal.
  Be  aware  that  using  some  streaming  services  downloaders  or  even  official  
Deezer/Tidal/Spotify
 
apps,
 
you
 
might
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
find
 
or
 
even
 
play
 
there
 
some
 
specific
 
tracks
 
or
 
albums
 
due
 
to:
 a)  premium  lock  (it  won't  be  played  for  free  users)   b)  regional  lock  (search  will  come  up  empty  [the  same  applies  to  Tidal  here])  Example:  Spyair  -  Imagination  instrumental  -  it  shows  up  in  search  probably  in  Japan,  
though
 
it
 
cannot
 
be
 
downloaded
 
using
 
2)
 
https://free-mp3-download.net,
 
but
 
deemix
 
with
 
premium
 
Deezer
 
subscription
 
did
 
the
 
job
 
in
 
downloading
 
the
 
song
 
(not
 
sure
 
if
 
it
 
was
 
Japan
 
account).
  PS.  You  can  cancel  your  trial  subscription  of  Deezer  or  Tidal  immediately  to  avoid  being  
charged
 
in
 
the
 
future,
 
but
 
also
 
keeping
 
the
 
access
 
to
 
premium
 
till
 
the
 
previous
 
charge
 
date
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
  Warning:  Qobuz  started  banning  accounts  using  Qobuz-DL;  can’t  guarantee  that  other  
downloaders
 
are
 
not
 
affected.
  7)  https://github.com/yarrm80s/orpheusdl Supports  Qobuz,  Tidal  (with  this module,  and  unlike  tidal-dl,  also  downloads  files  greater  than  24/48  and  Atmos)  and  probably  more   7a)  Bas  Curtiz  GUI for  Orpheus  (still  needs  working  subscription)   7b) QobuzDownloaderX-MOD  (*May  not  work  anymore)  7*)  If  you  have  a  Qobuz  subscription,  you  can  just  use  qobuz-dl (last  updated  a  year  ago,  probably  no  longer  works,  but  not  sure,  there  might  be  some  alternative  already).
