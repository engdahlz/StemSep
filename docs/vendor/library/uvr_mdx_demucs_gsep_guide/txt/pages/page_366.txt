    1.  Now  open  the  Colab  link  in  your  browser  2.  Click  the  “play”  button  on  the  "GDrive  connection"  cell.  Grant  all  the  privileges  (otherwise  
there
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
error).
 
 Don't  use  any  other  account  than  you're  already  logged  in  in  the  right  top  corner  (otherwise  it  
will
 
error
 
out).
 3.  Click  the  “play”  button  on  the  "Install"  cell,  and  wait  patiently  til  it's  finished  (it  should  show  
a
 
green
 
checkmark
 
on
 
the
 
side
 
afterwards)
 
-
 
be
 
aware
 
that
 
rarely
 
it
 
can
 
take
 
a
 
longer
 
time
 
than
 
in
 
most
 
cases.
 4.  Now  pick  your  model  in  "Separation"  cell.  5.  Click  the  “play”  button  on  the  "Separation"  cell.  Don't  provide  any  filenames  in  input_folder  path  there.  It  will  batch  process  all  the  files  inside  
the
 
input
 
folder.
 Default  settings  are  already  balanced  in  terms  of  SDR,  and  not  too  resource-intensive  
(increasing
 
overlap
 
might
 
muddy
 
instrumentals
 
a
 
bit,
 
8
 
might
 
have
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
information
 
on
 
spectrogram
 
iirc
 
in
 
vocals).
 TTA  increases  SDR  a  bit.  I'd  leave  it  turned  on,  although  it  will  separate  3  times.  Chunk_size  should  be  left  default,  as  it's  the  value  used  by  most  models,  but  iirc  beta  6  uses  
higher
 
chunks.
 
Refer
 
to
 
the
 
yaml
 
of
 
the
 
model,
 
as
 
the
 
Colab
 
will
 
override
 
yaml
 
setting.
 6.  After  it's  done,  it  will  output  the  stems  in  the  output.  7.  Before  closing,  go  to  Environment  and  delete  the  environment  manually,  so  you  won't  
exceed
 
your
 
free
 
Colab
 
credits
 
(so
 
you’ll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
e.g.
 
next
 
day).
 You  should  be  able  to  use  the  Colab  for  3,5h+  per  day  (I  think  4h  in  at  least  not  one  single  
separation
 
job
 
started).
 If  your  GPU  gets  disconnected,  change  the  Google  account  in  the  right  top  corner  of  the  
Colab
 
and
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
account
 
to
 
mount
 
GDrive.
  Colab  of  6  stem  undef13  splifft -  SW  BS-Roformer  model,  but  in  FP16  (almost  identical  metrics,  but  faster)    Custom  Model  Import Version  of  the  inference  Colab  by  jarredou.   You  can  use  it  if  we  don’t  add  any  new  model  to  the  main  Colab  on  time,  or  you  test  your  
own
 
models.
 
 
Just
 
make
 
sure
 
you
 
“you
 
have
 
downloaded
 
the
 
webpage
 
presenting
 
the
 
model
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
itself.”
 E.g.  for  yamls  from  GH,  use  e.g.:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/main/configs/
config_vocals_mdx23c.yaml'
 Instead  of:  
https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/main/configs/config_vocals_
mdx23c.yaml'
 
And
 
for
 
HF,
 
follow
 
the
 
pattern
 
presented
 
in
 
the
 
Colab
 
example
 
(so
 
with
 
the
 
resolve
 
in
 
the
 
address)
