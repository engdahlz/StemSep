    -  Also,  there  has  been  added  a  new  multichannel  section  in  “experimental”  it’s  just  for  songs  
with
 
3
 
or
 
more
 
audio
 
channels
 
like
 
e.g.
 
Dolby
 
Atmos
 
(FLAC/WAV
 
input
 
supported).
 
It’s
 
just
 
BS-Roformer
 
and
 
there’s
 
“no
 
reason
 
to
 
process
 
stereo
 
tracks
 
with
 
it”.
 
Also,
 
the
 
original
 
sample
 
rate
 
of
 
the
 
input
 
file
 
is
 
preserved
 
here.
 -  One  of  MVSEP’s  GPU  died  recently,  so  the  separations  will  be  probably  slower  than  usual.   -  jarredou  updated  his  AudioSR  Colab.  Now  “each  processed  chunk  is  normalised  at  same  LUFS  level  (fixes  the  volume  drop  issue)”  plus  “input  audio  is  resampled  accordingly  to  
'input_cutoff'
 
(instead
 
of
 
lowpass
 
filtering)”
 Now  also  some  errors  associated  with  mono  files  are  fixed.   -  New  drums  model  available  on  x-minus.pro  “SDR  is:  12.4066.  Thanks  to  @viperx  for  model  training!  The  model  is  trained  on  995  songs.  A  small  number  of  
my
 
pairs
 
were
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
dataset.”

 Very  positive  reviews  so  far.   -  New  guitar  model  added  on  MVSEP   “Previous  old  model  mdx23c:  4.87  New  mdx23c  model:  6.34  New  MelRoformer  model:  6.91  Ensemble  MDX23c  +  MelRoformer:  7.10  Extract  vocals  and  after  apply  ensemble  MDX23C  +  MelRoformer:  7.28”   -  If  x-minus.pro  site  doesn’t  work  for  you,  use  the  clone  instead:  https://uvronline.app/ai?hp  -  Demudder  on  x-minus  was  updated  on  13.06  (cosmetic  differences)   -  “Some  interesting  updates  to  SL  11  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BoEgBGiafM”  Seemingly,  separation  features  got  better.  Coming  on  19th  June.  Their  new  algo  was  evaluated,  and  SDR  is  a  bit  worse  than  htdemucs 4  stem  non  ft  model.  Every  stem  has  some  bleed,  vocals  are  decent,  and  actually  have  better  SDR  than  
Demucs_ft.
 
GPU
 
processing
 
in
 
options
 
has
 
low
 
utilization
 
and
 
is
 
slow,
 
they
 
say
 
it’s
 
planned
 
to
 
be
 
fixed
 
in
 
patch.
 
16GB
 
VRAM
 
recommended
 
at
 
least
 
while
 
using
 
brass
 
and
 
saxophone.
 
Around
 
18
 
models
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
total.
 Unmix  Mulitple  Voices  is  for  speech  case,  not  for  singing  case.  Unmix  Drums  option  can  serve  for  further  separation  of  drums  “the  residual  kick/snare  problem  is  much  better,  but  the  cymbal  split  does  still  contain  bleed  
from
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
song
 
sadly”
