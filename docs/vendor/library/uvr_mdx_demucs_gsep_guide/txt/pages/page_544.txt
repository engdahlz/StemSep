    to  disappear  soon  (if  they  don’t  take  your  upload  down)  or  if  another  war  will  break  out  and  
increasing
 
energy
 
costs
 
will
 
make
 
smaller
 
services
 
unprofitable
 
like
 
not
 
long
 
ago.
  Paid:   -  You  can  get  1TB  OneDrive  with  an  .edu  email   -  If  you  sign  up  for  the  Google  Workspace  (it  was  called  G  Suite  until  recently)  version  of  
Google
 
Drive,
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
1TB
 
for
 
~$10
 
USD
 
a
 
month,
 
but
 
here's
 
the
 
thing...
 
I
 
have
 
been
 
way
 
over
 
1tb
 
for
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
years
 
now,
 
and
 
they
 
have
 
never
 
charged
 
me
 
anymore.
 
I
 
am
 
over
 
4tb
 
now
 
and
 
have
 
been
 
for
 
~3
 
months,
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
still
 
only
 
~$10.
 
If
 
you
 
do
 
it,
 
just
 
create
 
a
 
1
 
user
 
account
 
and
 
just
 
keep
 
filling
 
it
 
up
 
until
 
they
 
say
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
add
 
more
 
users
 
or
 
pay
 
more.
  Well  it  looks  like  it  is  $12  now,  but  it's  for  2tb  and  maybe  that  is  what  they  change  my  plan  to  
and
 
are
 
charging
 
me
 
now
 
too…
 
I
 
thought
 
there
 
was
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
surcharge
 
and
 
tax
 
(never
 
really
 
paid
 
attention
 
to
 
the
 
exact
 
amount)
 
but
 
guess
 
it
 
is
 
just
 
$12
 
+
 
tax
 
now...
 https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html  It  looks  like  they  might  have  gotten  rid  of  it,  but  it  used  to  be  $50/month  for  unlimited  storage,  
but
 
I
 
think
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
do
 
what
 
I
 
do,
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
is
 
probably
 
close
 
to
 
unlimited
 
for
 
$12/month
  It's  pretending  you're  in  a  college  and  college  drives  have  infinite  storage   I  used  to  have  one  for  1-2  years,  but  it  suddenly  got  removed,  so  it's  not  safe.  All  the  files  are  
gone
 
too,
 
without
 
notice
  BTW.  For  workspace  you  still  need  to  have  your  own  domain  (with  the  possibility  of  changing  
DNS
 
entries,
 
so
 
free
 
ones
 
are
 
out).
 
Yearly
 
cost
 
is
 
negligible,
 
but
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
remember
 
about
 
it.
  -  Also,  if  you  have  ProtonVPN  on  the  Proton  Unlimited  plan,  you  get  500GB  of  storage  on  
Proton
 
Drive
 
for
 
free.
 
  -  Also,  Google  Pixel  1  phones  used  to  have  like  unlimited  or  at  least  bigger  GDrive  plans  iirc  
(it
 
was
 
withdrawn
 
from
 
later
 
Pixel
 
phones).
 
Some
 
people
 
bought
 
these
 
phones
 
just
 
for
 
the
 
space.
  -  You  can  get  very  cheap  2TB  (around  16$)  for  a  year  on  Google  Drive  in  Lyres  (I  think  they  
only
 
changed
 
it
 
in
 
methods
 
of
 
payment,
 
not
 
necessarily
 
whole
 
region),
 
but
 
some
 
people
 
say
 
it's
 
better
 
to
 
get
 
it
 
in
 
Brazil
 
due
 
to
 
fewer
 
problems.
 I  heard  it's  better  to  not  buy  it  in  Lyres  on  your  main  account,  because  your  apps  can  get  
regional
 
lock
 
(e.g.
 
Tidal).
 
Some
 
people
 
even
 
had
 
problems
 
with
 
currency
 
in
 
their
 
other
 
accounts,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
change
 
it
 
only
 
once
 
for
 
a
 
year
 
on
 
an
 
account,
 
and
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
some
