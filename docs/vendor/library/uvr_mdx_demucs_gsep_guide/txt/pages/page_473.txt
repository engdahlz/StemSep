      Harmonic  mixing  (find  the  song  key)   “Since  mixed  in  key  change  from  10  to  11  the  software  has  several  failures  especially  when  
overwriting
 
the
 
file
 
name
 
and
 
an
 
error
 
that
 
base
 
84
 
error,
 
and
 
you
 
are
 
left
 
without
 
the
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
file
 
thing.
 
Which
 
is
 
essential
 
when
 
doing
 
remixes
 
and
 
having
 
a
 
clarity
 
of
 
the
 
tone
 
and
 
bpm.
 
Someone
 
knows
 
of
 
an
 
alternative
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
make
 
a
 
mistake”

Audioshake   Paid,  $16  per  wav  stem,  2  or  5  stems  (6?  (guitar  and  piano)  or  4  stems  for  preview  (Indie  
creators)
  Better  piano  model  than  GSEP.  "gsep  piano  model  is  very  clean  but  sometimes  fails  in  bigger  mix,  when  there  are  a  lot  of  
instruments"
 And  also  guitar  stem     Instead  of  Audioshake  you  can  use:   -  myxt.com  (also  paid,  3  stem  model,  prob.  16kHz  cutoff  which  Audioshake  normally  doesn't  
have.
 
No
 
other
 
stem.
 
Results,

slightly
 
better

 -  Algoriddim  djay  pro   -   Neural  Mix  Pro  (part  of  Algoriddim,  also  uses  Audioshake),  but  it’s  only  for  MacOS  -  LANDR  Stems  (cheaper,  also  uses Audioshake;  plugin,  probably  doesn’t  work  locally,  free  access  won’t  give  you  access  to  stems;  “LANDR  Stems  is  only  included  in  Studio  Standard  +  Studio  Pro”  it’s  not  included  in  trial;  SDR:  1 |  2)  -  https://twoshot.app/model/289  Audioshake  is  suspected  that  it  is  just  MDX  with  expanded  dataset,  but  there’s  no  evidence

is

they’re
