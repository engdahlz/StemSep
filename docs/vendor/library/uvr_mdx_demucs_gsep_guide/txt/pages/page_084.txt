    https://github.com/jarredou/models/releases/tag/aufr33-jarredou_MDX23C_DrumSep_model_v0.1  Use  on  Colab:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/jarredou/Music-Source-Separation-Training-Colab-Inference/blob/main/Music_Source_Separation_Training_(Colab_Inference).ipynb”    It  works  in  UVR  too.  All  models  should  be  located  in  the  following  folder:  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\MDX_Net_Models   Don't  forget  about  copying  the  config  file  to:  model_data\mdx_c_configs   The  model  achieved  much  better  SDR  on  small  private  jarredou's  evaluation  dataset  
compared
 
to
 
the
 
previous
 
drumsep
 
model
 
by
 
Inagoy
 
which
 
was
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
worse
 
dataset
 
and
 
older

arch.
  The  dataset  for  further  training  is  available  in  the  drums  section  of  Repository  of  stems/multitracks  -  you  can  potentially  clean  it  further  and/or  expand  the  dataset  so  the  results  might  be  better  after  resuming  the  training  from  checkpoint.  Using  the  current  
dataset,
 
the
 
SDR
 
might
 
stall
 
for
 
quite
 
some
 
amount
 
of
 
epochs
 
or
 
even
 
decrease,
 
but
 
it
 
usually
 
increases
 
later,
 
so
 
potentially
 
training
 
it
 
further
 
to
 
300-500-1000
 
epochs
 
might
 
be
 
beneficial.
 “I’ve  had  models  where  SDR  changes  by  0.01  but  fullness/bleedless  change  with  10-15  
points,
 
I
 
wouldn’t
 
trust
 
it
 
that
 
much”

  Current  model  metrics:   “Instr  SDR  kick:  18.4312  Instr  SDR  snare:  13.6083  Instr  SDR  toms:  13.2693  Instr  SDR  hh:  6.6887  Instr  SDR  ride:  5.3227  Instr  SDR  crash:  7.5152  SDR  Avg:  10.8059”  Aufr33    And  if  evaluation  dataset  hasn't  changed  since  then,  the  old  Drumsep  SDR:   “kick   :  13.9216  snare  :   8.2344  toms   :   5.4471  (I  can't  compare  cymbals  score  as  it's  different  stem  types)”  -  jarredou   After  initial  jarredou’s  training  in  Colab,  Aufr33  decided  to  train  the  model  for  additional  7  
days,
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
above
 
epoch
 
113
 
(perhaps
 
around
 
150,
 
it
 
wasn't
 
said
 
precisely),
 
while
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
config,
 
but
 
on
 
a
 
faster
 
GPU
 
(2x
 
4090).
