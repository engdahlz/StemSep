     As  mentioned  before,  after  runtime  disconnection  error,  output  folder  still  constantly

  -"Image-Line  the  company  that  made  Fl  Studio  21  took  to  instagram  announcing  a  beta  build

separate

 People  say  it's  Demucs  4,  but  maybe  not  ft  model  and/or  with  low  parameters  applied  or/and  
it's
 
their
 
own
 
model.
 "Nothing  spectacular,  but  not  bad."  "-  FL  Studio  bleeds  beats,  just  like  Demucs  4  FT  -  FL  Studio  sounds  worse  than  Demucs  4  FT  -  Ripple  clearly  wins"   -Org.  KaraFan  Colab with  v.  3.0  should  work  with  the  large  GPU  option  disabled  (now  done  by  default).   -You  may  be  experiencing  issues  with  KaraFan  3.0  alpha  (e.g.  lack  of  5_F-music  with  which  the  result  was  better  before),  and  using  Kubinka  Colab which  uses  the  older  version  for  now  has  some  problems  with  GPU  acceleration.  Maybe  the  previous  KF  commit  will  work  or  even  the  one  before  (2.x  is  used  here).   -New  UVR  beta  patches  for  Windows/Mac/M1  at  the  bottom  of  the  release  note  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/  Usually  check  for  newer  versions  above,  but  this  one  currently  fixes  long  error  on  using  the  
new
 
BVE
 
model
 https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/download/v5.5.0/UVR_Patch_9_20_23_20_40_BETA.exe  -  “The  new  BVE  (Background  Vocal  Extractor)  model  [in  UVR  5  GUI]  has  been  released!   To  use  the  BVE  model,  please  make  sure  you  use  the  UVR_Patch_9_18_23_18_50_BETA patch  (Mac).  Remember,  it's  designed  to  be  used  in  a  chain  ensemble,  not  on  its  own.  It's  better  to  utilize  it  via  "Vocal  Splitter  Options".  ~Anjok”   Using  Lead  vocal  placement   =  stereo  80%  is  still  only  available  on  X-Minus  only.  UVR  GUI  
doesn't
 
support
 
this
 
yet
 
-
 
it’s
 
for
 
the
 
situation
 
when
 
your
 
main
 
vocals
 
are
 
confused
 
with
 
backing
 
vocals.
  -  In  the  latest  UVR  GUI  beta  patch,  vocal  stems  of  MDX  instrumental  models  have  polarity  
flipped.
 
You
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
flip
 
it
 
back
 
in
 
your
 
DAW.
