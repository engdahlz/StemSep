    A:  https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18407 (Why  does  music  source  separation  benefit  from  cacophony?)  https://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2024-030.pdf (same  non-columns  formatting)  “It  thus  appears  that  a  small  amount  of  random  mixes  composed  of  stems  from  a  larger  set  
of
 
songs
 
performs
 
better
 
than
 
a
 
large
 
amount
 
of
 
random
 
mixes
 
composed
 
of
 
stems
 
from
 
a
 
smaller
 
set
 
of
 
songs.”
 If  needed,  the  training  script  that  ZFTurbo  has  made  does  handle  random  and  aligned  
dataset
 
and
 
has
 
also
 
SCNet
 
implementation:
 https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training  Q:  As  I  know,  SCNet  supports  only  for  inference  here.  A:  It  does  training  too,  ZFTurbo  has  recently  trained  a  SCNet-large  model  on  MUSDB18  
dataset

Creating  dataset  -  guide  by  Bas  Curtiz  (now  also  video available)   How  to:  Create  a  dataset  for  training   1.  Download  any  sample  pack  that  is  focused  around  inst/synth  x  or  y.  (sources  to  seek  on:  audioz.download,  magesy.blog,  rutracker.org,  freesounds.org,  etc.)   2.  Use  real-debrid.com  or  alldebrid.com  to  speed  things  up  DL-wise  (costs  a  few  bucks  but  worth  it,  so  better  prepare  so  u  can  sign  up  for  a  free  trial  or  a  3  bucks  access  for  x  amount  of  days)   3.  Unzip  all  (so  they  are  all  in  a  separate  individual  folder)   4.  Convert  all  to  make  it  consistent  (I  use  https://www.dbpoweramp.com/  to  batch-process)  a)  Convert  all  to  WAV/16-bit/Stereo  &  delete  any  other  audio  format  like  AIFF,  MP3,  OGG.  b)  Convert  all  to  FLAC  (saves  space  without  degrading  quality)  c)  Delete  all  *.WAV  files   5.  a)  Move  all  files  to  root  folder  of  the  individual  folder.  (I  use  a  python  script  for  that.  Hit  me  up  so  I  can  share.)  b)  Remove  empty  directories  (I  use  https://sourceforge.net/projects/rem-empty-dir/  to  batch-process)   _____________________  For  help  and  discussion,  visit  our  Audio  Separation  Discord:  https://discord.gg/ZPtAU5R6rP |  Download  UVR or MSST-GUI  For  inst/voc  separation  in  cloud,  try  out  free  Colabs:  BS/Mel-Roformer
