     Instead,  you  can  also  consider  using  linear  phase  EQ/mode  like  in  free  Qrange  and  its  high  
pass
 
to
 
potentially
 
cause
 
less
 
problems
 
in
 
phase.
  Similar  method  to  this  can  also  be  used  for  joining  YT  Opus  frequencies  above  15750Hz  with  AAC  (m4a)  files,  which  gives  more  clarity  compared  to  normal  Opus  on  YT.  Read  this.   
DAW  ensemble   Averaging   The  counterpart  of  avg  ensemble  from  UVR  (more)  can  also  be  made  in  a  DAW  (Audacity/Cakewalk/Reaper  etc.).  When  you  drag  and  align  all  stems  you  want  to  ensemble  
in
 
your
 
DAW,
 
you
 
simply
 
need
 
to
 
lower
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
stems
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
imported
 
stems
 
to
 
ensemble.
 It's  -3  dB  per  one  stem  for  replicating  avg  spec,  so  for  a  pair  you  need  to  decrease  the  
volume
 
of
 
two
 
stems
 
by
 
6
 
dB
 
(possibly
 
by
 
6.02
 
as
 
well).
  So,  when  you  add  another  stem  (so  for  3  models  ensemble),  you  need  to  decrease  the  
volume
 
of
 
all
 
stems
 
by
 
9dB,
 
and
 
so
 
on.
  The  other  way  round,  it's  3dB  decrease  for  all  stems  every  time  you  import  a  new  track.   Weighting  manually  (more  precise)   You  can  change  volume  of  stems  to  your  liking,  just  to  not  cause  clipping  having  too  loud  
output
 
on
 
master
 
fader
 
once
 
you
 
play.
 
You
 
can
 
circumvent
 
the
 
problem
 
to
 
some
 
extent
 
using
 
a
 
limiter
 
on
 
the
 
sum,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
necessary.
 
 
Also,
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
different
 
volume
 
automation
 
of
 
stems
 
towards
 
specific
 
verses
 
and
 
choruses,
 
or
 
just
 
different
 
volume
 
relation
 
of
 
stems
 
whenever
 
a
 
new
 
verse
 
or
 
chorus
 
appear.
  Note:  You  won’t  be  able  to  use  that  method  if  one  stem  had  phase  rotated  or  flipped.   "I've  made  some  tests  by  simply  overlaying  each  audio  above  each  other  and  reducing  their  
volume
 
proportionally
 
of
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
audio
 
overlays
 
(like
 
you
 
would
 
do
 
in
 
a
 
DAW),
 
it
 
scores
 
like
 
~0.0002
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
UVR's
 
average."
  You  can  use  Audacity  online  at  wavacity.com,  although  it  might  crash  occasionally  while  
using
 
on
 
at
 
least
 
smartphone.
 Bandlab  is  more  stable  while  using  as  app:  https://www.bandlab.com/explore/home but  also  crashes  when  used  in  PC  mode  online.
