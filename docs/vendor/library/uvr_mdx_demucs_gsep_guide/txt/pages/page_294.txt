     "The  idea  is  that  you  shift  the  track  just  enough  where  for  example  if  you  have  a  hip  hop  
track,
 
and
 
the
 
same
 
instrumental
 
tracks
 
the
 
drums
 
will
 
overlap
 
again
 
in
 
rhythm,
 
but
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
shifted
 
in
 
time
 
so
 
basically
 
Center
 
Extract
 
will
 
extract
 
similar
 
sounds.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
that
 
similarity
 
to
 
further
 
invert/clean
 
tracks...
 
It
 
works
 
on
 
tracks
 
where
 
samples
 
are
 
not
 
necessarily
 
the
 
same,
 
too…”
 >  Step-by-step  guide  by  Vinctekan  (video)   1.  You  take  your  desired  audio  file  2.  Open  it  in  Audacity  3.  Split  Stereo  to  Mono  4.  Click  the  left  speaker  channel  (now  mono),  and  duplicate  it  with  Ctrl+D.  *:  If  the  original  and  duplicate  is  not  beside  eachother,  move  it  so  that  it's  next  to  eachother  5:  Select  the  original  left  speaker  channel  and  it's  duplicate,  and  click  "Make  Stereo  Track"  6:  Solo  it.  7.  Export  it  in  Audacity,  preferably  in  44100hz  since  UVR  doesn't  output  in  higher  
frequencies.
 
Format,
 
and
 
bit
 
depth
 
don't
 
really
 
matter,
 
I
 
prefer
 
wav
 
always.
 8:  Do  the  same  thing  for  the  right  speaker  channel.  9:  Open  UVR  10:  Navigate  to  Audio  Tools>Manual  Ensemble.  11:  Make  sure  to  choose  Min  Spec  (since  that  function  is  supposed  to  isolate  the  common  
frequencies
 
of
 
2
 
outputs)
 12:  Select  the  2  exported  fake  stereo  files  of  both  the  left  and  right  speaker  channels.  13:  Hit  process  ___   20.  Q&A  for  the  above   Q:  For  the  right  channel  are  you  doing  the  same  with  the  duplicate  and  moving  the  file  next  
to
 
the
 
original
 
or
 
just
 
duplicating
 
and
 
making
 
that
 
stereo?
  A:  Those  2  steps  go  hand  in  hand.  These  reason  I  mentioned  it  is  because  if  you  try  to  make  
a
 
Stereo
 
Track
 
with
 
those
 
2
 
(the
 
left/right
 
channel
 
speaker,
 
and
 
it's
 
duplicate
 
mono])
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
track
 
between
 
them,
 
it
 
doesn't
 
work.
 
Even
 
if
 
you
 
select
 
those
 
2
 
with
 
Ctrl
 
held
 
down.
  Take  that  1  channel  (left/right),  Ctrl+C,  Ctrl+V,  now  you  have  2  of  the  exact  same  audio.  Hold  
Ctrl
 
select
 
the
 
2,
 
click
 
"Make
 
Stereo
 
Track".
 
Finally,
 
export.
  21.  Passing  through  lot  of  models  one  by  one   "I  usually  do  ensemble  to  make  an  instrumental  first,  then  demucs  4_ft…  sometimes  I  do  it  
once,
 
then
 
take
 
that
 
rendered
 
file
 
and
 
pass
 
it
 
back
 
through
 
the
 
algo
 
a
 
few
 
more
 
times,
 
depends
 
until
 
it
 
strips
 
out
 
artifacts."
