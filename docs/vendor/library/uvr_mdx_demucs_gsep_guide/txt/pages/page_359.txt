    "Throwing  a  Demix  Pro  karaoke  model  for  comparison...  I  think  the  bgv  parts  still  sound  
better
 
for
 
this
 
song,
 
but
 
demix
 
has
 
more
 
noise
 
on
 
the
 
lead
 
parts
  Demix  keeps  more  backing  [backround]  (and  somehow  the  lead  vocals  are  also  better  most  
of
 
the
 
time,
 
with
 
fuller
 
sound)"
  "MDX  in  its  pure  form  is  too  aggressive  and  removes  a  lot  of  backing  vocals.  However,  if  we  
apply
 
min_mag_k
 
processing,
 
the
 
results
 
become
 
closer
 
to
 
Demix
 
Pro.”
  “In  the  future,  we  will  create  a  [b.v.]  model  for  Demucs  V4.  The  MDX-NET  is  not  really  well  
suited
 
for
 
such
 
a
 
purpose."
  Update  24.12.22  Wind  instruments  model  (saxophone,  trumpet,  etc.)  added  to  x-minus  for  premium  users  
(since
 
March
 
now
 
also
 
in
 
UVR5).
  "I  tested.  Maximum  aggressiveness  extracts  the  most  amount  of  instrument,  while  minimum  
the
 
least.
 
The
 
model
 
is
 
not
 
bad
 
at
 
all,
 
but
 
has
 
hiccups
 
often
 
(maybe
 
it
 
needs
 
a
 
much
 
larger
 
dataset)"
  Maximum  aggressiveness  "gives  you  more  wind".   Update  20/19.12.22  New  UVR5  GUI  5.5.0  rewrite  was  released.  Lots  of  changes  and  faster  processing.  MDX  2.1  model  added  as  inst  main  (inst  main  496)  in  UVR5  GUI.   -  There  was  some  confusion  about  MDX  2.1  model  being  vocal  438,  but  it’s  inst  main.  MacOS  native  build  available  on  GitHub.  VIP  models  are  now  available  for  free  with  a  donation  option.   More  changes:  "Pre-process  mode  for  Demucs  is  actually  very  useful.  Basically,  you  can  choose  a  solid  
mdx-net
 
or
 
VR
 
model
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
heavy
 
lifting
 
in
 
removing
 
vocals
 
and
 
Demucs
 
can
 
get
 
the
 
rest
 
with
 
far
 
less
 
vocal
 
bleed"
  "Secondary  Models  are  a  massive  expansion  of  the  old  "Demucs  Model"  check  button  
MDX-Net
 
used
 
to
 
have.
 
You'll
 
want
 
to
 
play
 
around
 
with
 
those
 
to
 
find
 
what
 
works
 
for
 
the
 
tracks
 
your
 
processing."
  There  was  also  Spectral  Inversion  added,  but  it  seems  to  decrease  SDR  slightly.   There  was  an  additional  cutoff  to  MDX  models  introduced  -  “Just  a  heads  up,  for  mdx-net,  
the
 
secondary
 
stem
 
frequencies
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
cut-off
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
stems
 
now
 
 There  were  complaints  about  lingering  vocals  (or  instrumentals  depending  on  the  model)  in  
the
 
upper
 
frequencies
 
that
 
was
 
audible
 
and
 
very
 
bothersome”
