I

it

the

All  unwa  models  were  trained  on  3060  Ti!   -  Unwa  released  400MB  experimental  BS-Roformer  inst  model   https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/BS-Roformer-Inst-EXP-Value-Residual It’s  using  a  new  Value  Residual  Learning  added  to  Roformer  arch  by  Lucidrains  in  the  OG

combined

I
 
can
 
confidently

more
