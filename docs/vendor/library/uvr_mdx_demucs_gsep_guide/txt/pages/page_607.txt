    At  this  moment,  training  works  only  on  Linux  or  WSL.   SDR  seems  to  be  higher  than  all  the  current  archs,  maybe  besides  Mel/BS  Roformers  
(weren’t
 
tested).
 
“It's
 
in
 
between
 
SCNet
 
and
 
Rofos
 
but
 
maybe
 
more
 
lightweight
 
than
 
them.
 (...)  From  the  scores  from  MelBand  paper  [it  seems]  the  Rofos  are  still  like  +0.5  SDR  
average
 
above
 
the
 
other
 
archs
 
when
 
trained
 
on
 
musdb18
 
only.
 But  it's  great  to  finally  see  some  mamba-inspired  MSS  arch  with  great  performance”.  As  for  22.09.24,  ZFTurbo  had  problems  with  low  SDR  during  training.   https://discord.com/channels/708579735583588363/1220364005034561628/1286650425596186645 https://discord.com/channels/708579735583588363/1220364005034561628/1284221988294099102   Another  three  very  promising  archs  for  the  moment:   Conformer  “performs  just  as  well  if  not  better  than  a  standard  Roformer”  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08100 https://github.com/lucidrains/conformer (people  already  train  with  it,  and  its  implementation  might  be  pushed  to  the  MSST  repo  in  not  
distant
 
future)

 It  has  shown steady  improvement  in  training  in  the  last  12  hours  from  epoch  0  to  83  (1  SDR  increase  on  private  validation  dataset,  probably  on  A100XL  (80GB)  on  “thunder  compute”  
$1.05/hour)
 
and
 
the
 
shared
 
weight
 
is
 
epoch
 
200+.
