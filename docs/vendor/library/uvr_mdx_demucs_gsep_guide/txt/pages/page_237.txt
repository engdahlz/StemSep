 “guitar  model  sounds  better  than  demucs,  mvsep,  and  moises”  -  Sausum  “it's  not  a  fullness  emphasis  or  anything,  but  it's  shockingly  good  at  understanding  different  
types
 
of
 
instruments
 
and
 
keeping
 
them

sounding”

 vocals  doesn’t  have  the  biggest  metric,  but  are  good  for  deep  voices.   
Drums
 
lacks
 
some
 
fullness
 
but
 
“I
 
got
 
better
 
drums/bass
 
separation
 
with
 
that
 
model
 
than
 
with
 
any
 
others
 
when

 Although,  compared  with  Mel-Roformer  drums  on  uvronline:  “separates  far  far  better  when  it’s  programmed  instruments  compared  to  actual  recorded  
ones”

 “Roformer  SW  is  putting  finger  snaps  and  foot  taps  as  vocals  and  in  the  vocal  stems.”  -

 “gets  not  just  drums  but  anything  percussive/non-melodic.  Which  I  personally  don't  mind,  but  yeah  it  does  cause  problems  with  drumsep models  because  they're  only  expecting  standard  drums.”  Bass  can  be  occasionally  worse  vs  demucs_ft  as  bass  stem  Demucs  “considers  not  only  
spectrograms
 
but
 
also
 
waveforms”.
 “can't  differ  an  electric  bass  with  pedal  effect  from  an  electric  guitar”  -  qraiqu  "better  than  LalalAI  by  a  long  shot  too"  -  nowarrantywarren  As  for  MVSEP  “just  as  good  a  job  on  vocals  as  the  paid  version's  ensemble  preset.”  In  UVR  it  takes  two  hours  for  overlap  11  for  4  minute  file  to  separate  on  6700  XT.
