their
 
chart
 
showed
 
the
 
same

SDR
 
score
 
like
 
in
 
aircrowd.
   ___UVR  settings  for  ensemble  (section  deprecated,  see  the  section  above)__   Ensemble  can  provide  different  results  from  one  current  main  model,  but  not  especially  
better
 
in
 
all
 
cases,
 
so
 
it’s
 
also
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
taste
 
and
 
conscious
 
evaluation.
  -  Aggressiveness  shouldn’t  be  set  to  more  than  0.1  (also  check  0.01)  -  high_end_process:  bypass  (official  recommendation)  or  mirroring  2  (in  some  cases)  -  In  most  cases,  you  shouldn’t  use  more  than  4  models  to  not  decrease  the  quality  
(developer
 
recommendation)
  Don't  use  postprocessing  in  HV  Colab  for  ensemble  (doesn't  work).   Other  recommended  models  for  ensemble:    HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_1.pth,   HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_2.pth  (+new  3  band?)  as  they  currently  the  best  (15.08.21)  but  feel  free  to  experiment  with  more  (I  also  used  old  
MGM
 
beta
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
with
 
two
 
above,
 
 some  people  used  also  vocal  models  as  well,  and  later  there  was  also  
HP2-MAIN-MSB2-3BAND-3090_arch-500m
 
model
 
released,
 
which
 
gives
 
good
 
results
 
solo).
    ___Good  UVR  accapella  models______   In  general,  it’s  better  to  use  MDX-UVR  models  for  clean  acappellas,  but  for  UVR,  these  are  
going
 
to
 
be
 
your
 
best
 
bet:
  -  Vocal_HP_4BAND_3090  -  This  model  with  come  out  with  less  instrumental  bleed.  -  Vocal_HP_4BAND_3090_AGG  -  This  is  a  more  aggressive  version  of  the  vocal  model  
above.
 
  “If  you  wanna  removes  the  vocals  but  keeping  the  backing  vocals,  you  can  use  the  latest  BV  
model”
