    You  should  be  able  to  use  more  than  one  UVR  installation  at  the  same  time  when  one’s  
been
 
copied
 
before
 
updating
 
(potentially
 
patch
 
#10
 
will
 
still
 
work)
 
or
 
use
 
MSST
 
repo
 
and/or
 
its
 
GUIs.

#9:
 UVR_Patch_12_8_24_23_30_BETA   Windows:  Full |  Patch (Use  if  you  still  have  non-beta  UVR  installed)  |  Small  Patch (for  this  you  must  have  a  Roformer  patch  previously  installed  for  this  to  work)   UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #10   UVR_Patch_1_9_25_23_46_BETA_rofo_small_patch  -  Link For  now,  only  small  patch  for  already  existing  beta  Roformer  installation  above  is  available,  
and
 
only
 
for
 
Windows.
  If  you  have  Python  DLL  error  on  startup,  reinstall  the  last  beta  update  using  the  full  package  
instead,
 
then
 
the
 
small
 
installer
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
patch.
  Since  beta  version  #10,  UVR  doesn't  rely  on  'inference.dim_t'  value  for  Roformers  
anymore
 
(if
 
you
 
were
 
using
 
edited
 
"dim_t"
 
value
 
in
 
yaml
 
configuration
 
files).
 You  have  to  edit  audio.chunk_size  instead  if  need  it  (e.g.  for  4-12GB  VRAM  on  AMD/Intel).  It’s  located  “In  model  yaml  config  file,  at  top  of  it,  chunk_size  is  first  parameter  (...)  you  can  
edit
 
model
 
config
 
files
 
directly
 
inside
 
UVR
 
now.”
 
or
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
config
 
editor
 
in
 
newer
 
versions.
  “Conversion  between  dim_t  and  chunk_size   dim_t  =  801  is  chunk_size  =  352800  (8.00s)  dim_t  =  1101  is  chunk_size  =  485100  (11.00s)  dim_t  =  256  is  chunk_size  =  112455  (2,55s)  dim_t  =  1333  is  chunk_size  =  587412  (13,32s)   [more  values  later  below]   The  formula  is:  chunk_size  =  (dim_t  -  1)  *  hop_length)”  -  jarredou   Generally,  to  have  the  best  SDR,  use  chunks  not  lower  than  11s  in  the  yaml  for  inference,  
which
 
is
 
usually
 
training
 
chunks
 
value
 
(rarely
 
higher).
 
Although,
 
at
 
times
 
people
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
with
 
2,55s
 
chunks,
 
although
 
some
 
models
 
behave
 
worse
 
than
 
others
 
with
 
such
 
small
 
values.
  “most  of  the  time  using  higher  chunk_size  than  the  one  used  during  training  gives  a  bit  better  
SDR
 
score,
 
until
 
a
 
peak
 
value,
 
and
 
then
 
quality
 
degrades.
 For  Roformers  trained  with  8sec  chunk_size,  11  sec  is  giving  best  SDR  (then  it  degrades  
with
 
higher
 
chunk
 
size)
