    -  If  you  have  an  issue  with  Demucs  module  not  found  in  e.g.  MDX23  v.2.3  Colab  (now  fixed  there  and  also  in  VR  Colab),  here's  a  solution:   “In  the  installation  code,  I  added  `!pip  install  samplerate==0.1.0`  right  before  the  `!pip  install  
-r
 
requirements.txt
 
&>
 
/dev/null`
 
and
 
I
 
managed
 
to
 
get
 
all
 
the
 
dependencies
 
from
 
the
 
requirements.txt
 
installed
 
properly.”

  -   If  you  repost  your  images  or  files  from  Discord  elsewhere  while  cutting  link  after  "ex="  for  
all
 
new
 
posted
 
files,
 
it
 
will
 
make
 
your
 
files
 
expire
 
pretty
 
soon
 
(17.02.24).
 
If
 
you
 
leave
 
the
 
full
 
link
 
with
 
"ex="
 
and
 
so
 
on,
 
it
 
won't
 
expire
 
so
 
fast,
 
but
 
who
 
knows
 
if
 
not
 
later.
 So  far,  all  the  old  Discord  images  shared  elsewhere  with  "ex="  cut,  work  (also  in  incognito  
without
 
Discord
 
logged
 
in),
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
certain
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
that
 
way
 
forever.
 Discord  announced  in  the  end  of  2023,  that  they'll  update  their  mechanisms  of  sharing  links,  
so
 
they'll
 
expire
 
after
 
some
 
time
 
when
 
they're
 
shared,
 
to
 
avoid
 
some
 
security
 
vulnerabilities
 
allowing
 
scams.
 
Or
 
they
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
offload
 
the
 
servers.

 Not  bad  results.  They  use  Demucs.   -  For  people  with  low  VRAM  GPUs  (e.g.  4GB  or  less),  you  can  test  out  Replay app,  which  provides  voc_ft  model  and  tends  to  crash  less  than  UVR.  Sadly,  the  choice  of  models  is  much  smaller,  but  it  has  some  de-reverb  solution.  Screenshot  -  Latest  MVSep  changes:  1)  All  ensembles  now  have  option  to  output  intermediate  waveforms  from  independent  
algorithms
 
+
 
additional
 
max_mag,
 
min_mag.
 2)  Ensemble  All-In  now  includes  DrumSep  results  extracted  from  Drum  stem.   -  resemble-enhance  (GH)  model  added  on  x-minus  in  denoise  mode.  It  can  work  better  than  the  latest  denoise  model  on  x-minus.  It  is  intended  only  for  vocals.  For  music  use  UVR  
De-noise
 
model
 
on
 
x-minus.
  -  (fixed  in  kae,  2.1,  2.2  [and  KaraFan  irc]  Colabs)  All  Colabs  using  MDX-Net  models  are  
currently
 
very
 
slow.
 
GPU
 
acceleration
 
is
 
broken
 
and
 
separations
 
now
 
only
 
work
 
on
 
CPU
 
with
 
onnxruntime
 
warnings.
 To  work  around  the  issue,  go  to  Tools>Command  palette>Use  fallback  runtime  version  (while  
it's
 
still
 
available).
