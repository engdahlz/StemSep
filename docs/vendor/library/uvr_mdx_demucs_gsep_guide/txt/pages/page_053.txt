  -  (added  on  MVSEP  as  SDR  13.72)  ZFTurbo  trained  new  SCNet  XL  model  for  drums.  “I  have  2  versions:  one  is  slightly  higher  SDR  and  avg  Bleedless.   Second  is  better  for  fullness  and  L1Freq.  Previous  best  SDR  model  had  13.01  (it's  SCNet  Large).”  Metrics 15.7180  (13.72)  one  has  much  better  fullness  metric.  “It's  far  superior  to  the  other  one,  but  I  still  hear  some  weird  parts.  It  still  messes  up  on  some  percussion.  The  drums  stem  sounds  really  weird.  The  no  drums  is  alright  except  for  some  bleeding  but  yeah  the  drums  is  quite  muddy”  -

  -  Gabox  released  new  fine-tunes  of  his  inst  Mel-Roformer  models  (click):  inst_gabox2.ckpt,  inst_gabox3.ckpt.  INSTV5.ckpt.  INSTV6.ckpt  
with
 
one
 
opinion
 
that
 
the

one
 
is
 
his
 
best

so
 
far.
 
 
“seems
 
like
 
a

 “confuses  way  less  instruments  for  vocals  than  v1e,  but  it's  still  not  as  full  as  v1e  (...)  But  it's  
a
 
very
 
good
 
model”

about
 
it.
 
 -  anvuew  released  new  dereverb_mel_band_roformer_mono_anvuew_sdr_20.4029 model.  “supports  mono,  but  ability  to  remove  bleed  and  BV  is  decreased  
should
 
not
 
matter
 
whether
 
it's
 
singing
 
or
 
speech,
 
because
 
my
 
dataset
 
contains
 
speech.”
