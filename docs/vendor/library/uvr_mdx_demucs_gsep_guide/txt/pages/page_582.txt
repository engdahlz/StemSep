     “change  the  batch  size  in  config  tho  I  think  ZFTurbo  sets  the  default  config  suited  for  a  single  a6000  (48gb)  and  chunksize”  joowon   So,  to  sum  up,  BS-Roformer  is  the  best  publicly  available  arch  SDR-wise  for  now  (and  in  
practice,
 
Mel-Roformer
 
scores
 
a
 
bit
 
lower
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
datasets
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
public
 
code
 
we
 
currently
 
have),
 
although
 
both
 
are
 
very,
 
very
 
demanding
 
compared
 
to
 
MDX23C
 
or
 
MDX-Net
 
v2
 
or
 
VR
 
(voice-remover
 
by
 
tsurumeso).
  E.g.  Aufr33  said  that  BS  Roformer  turned  out  to  be  better  for  training  BVE  model.  “Although  I  
get
 
about
 
zero
 
or
 
even
 
negative
 
SDR
 
with
 
both,
 
the
 
BS
 
does
 
the
 
job
 
better.
 Maybe  it's  not  the  architecture  but  the  augmentation,  I  disabled  it  for  BS  ”.  Some  other  
explanations:
 “In  BS-Roformer  they  don't  do  any  downsampling  or  compression”  hence  it’s  so  slow  to  train.   “I've  noticed  that  it  separates  mono  (i.e.,  panned  in  the  center)  harmonies  well  if  the  two  
voices
 
belong
 
to
 
different
 
people,
 
and
 
much
 
worse
 
if
 
it's
 
the
 
same
 
singer
 
(even
 
though
 
they
 
differ
 
by
 
a
 
third
 
interval).
 
 This  leads  me  to  believe  that  the  BS  architecture  would  work  well  for  separating  female  and  
male
 
voices.”
 
(after
 
some
 
problems
 
with
 
SDR
 
being
 
in
 
the
 
region
 
of
 
0
 
or
 
1)
 
“I
 
have
 
another
 
thought.
 
Roformer
 
works
 
differently
 
with
 
stereo,
 
not
 
like
 
VR.
 
It's
 
like
 
it
 
partially
 
merges
 
channels,
 
which
 
is
 
bad
 
for
 
backing
 
vocal
 
detection.
 
It
 
seems
 
to
 
me
 
that
 
using
 
a
 
stereo
 
expander
 
would
 
help.”
 
Aufr33.
 
Eventually
 
he
 
later
 
started
 
the
 
training
 
Mel
 
from
 
scratch
 
on
 
4x
 
RTX
 
6000
 
Ada
 
using
 
stereo
 
expander
 
and
 
that
 
lower
 
training
 
rte,
 
and
 
eventually
 
it
 
started
 
to
 
increase
 
SDR,
 
but
 
later
 
negative
 
value
 
was
 
showing,
 
and
 
he
 
continued
 
training
 
BS
 
and
 
SDR
 
was
 
above
 
1,
 
but
 
it
 
stopped
 
progressing,
 
“It
 
seems
 
that
 
525
 
songs
 
is
 
not
 
enough
 
to
 
train
 
a
 
[BS/Mel]
 
model.”
  Some  things  here  can  be  outdated  already,  as  some  optimizations  were  introduced  to  the  
training
 
code
 
(read
 
more
 
below):
  __   Time-wise,  BS  vs  Mel,  instead  of  16x  a100  in  BS-Roformer,  it  might  be  like  14x  a100  to  train  
in
 
decent
 
time,
 
but
 
at
 
best,
 
without
 
the
 
config
 
tweak,
 
SDR
 
will
 
be
 
only
 
in
 
pair
 
with
 
MDX23
 
and
 
MDX-Net
 
archs
 
v2
 
archs,
 
and
 
BS-Roformer
 
will
 
achieve
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
Mel-Band.
 
Might
 
be
 
some
 
issue
 
in
 
Mel-Band
 
Roformer
 
reimplementation,
 
maybe
 
paper
 
lacking
 
something.
 
Only
 
in
 
BS-Roformer
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
original
 
authors
 
from
 
Bytedance
 
took
 
part
 
in
 
some
 
reviewing
 
of
 
the
 
reimplementation
 
code
 
made
 
by
 
lucidrains.
 On  Mel-Band,  epoch  3005  took  40  days  on  2xA100-40GB  with  the  previous  viperx  model.   Viperx  trained  their  own  vocal  model,  using  BS-Roformer  on  +4500  songs  (studio  stems  *  
+270h)
 
using
 
8xA100-80GB,
 
and
 
only
 
on
 
epoch
 
74
 
they
 
almost
 
surpassed
