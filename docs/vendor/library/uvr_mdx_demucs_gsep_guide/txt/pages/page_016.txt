I

 “NOISY  AF,  this  is  probably  the  dumbest  idea  ever  had  for  an  instrumental  model.  Don’t  use  
it
 
as
 
your
 
main
 
one,
 
some
 
vocals
 
will
 
leak
 
because
 
I
 
added
 
tracks
 
with
 
vocal
 
chops
 
to
 
the
 
dataset.
 
Just
 
use
 
this
 
model
 
for
 
songs
 
that
 
have
 
vocal
 
chops”
