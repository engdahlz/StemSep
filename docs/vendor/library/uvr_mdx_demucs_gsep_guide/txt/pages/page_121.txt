    works  pretty  well  [to  cancel  the  bleeding]”  if  it's  still  not  enough,  put  other  stem  through  
Bandlab
 
Splitter.
  -  If  you  suffer  from  vocal  residues  using  Ensemble  4  models  on  MVSEP.com,  decrease  
volume
 
of
 
input
 
file
 
by
 
-8dB
 
“now
 
it's
 
silent.
 
No
 
more
 
residue”
 
usually
 
3
 
or
 
4dB
 
was
 
doing
 
the
 
trick
 
for
 
Ripple,
 
but
 
here
 
it’s
 
different.
 
Might
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
too.
  -  Image  Line  “released  an  update  for  FL  Studio,  and  they  improved  the  stem  separation  and  
it's
 
better,
 
but
 
it
 
has
 
quite
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
bleeding
 
still,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
seems
 
they
 
may
 
have
 
improved
 
the
 
vocal
 
clarity”
  -  (probably  fixed  in  new  HV  MDX)  Our  newly  fixed  VR  and  newer  HV  MDX  Colabs  started  to  
have
 
issues
 
with
 
very
 
slow
 
initialization
 
for
 
some
 
people
 
(even
 
18
 
minutes/+
 
instead
 
of
 
normally
 
3).
 
It’s
 
probably
 
due
 
to
 
very
 
slow
 
download
 
of
 
some
 
dependencies.
 
Possible
 
solutions:
 
use
 
other
 
Google
 
account,
 
use
 
VPN,
 
make
 
another
 
Google
 
account
 
(maybe
 
using
 
Polish
 
VPN).
 
Let
 
us
 
know
 
if
 
it
 
happens
 
only
 
for
 
some
 
specific
 
dependency
 
or
 
all
 
of
 
them.
 
You
 
can
 
try
 
to
 
uncomment
 
the
 
ORT
 
nightly
 
line
 
in
 
mounting
 
cell
 
(add
 
#
 
before),
 
as
 
it
 
triggers
 
more
 
dependencies
 
to
 
be
 
installed,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
slow
 
in
 
that
 
case.
 
The
 
downside
 
is
 
-
 
there
 
won't
 
be
 
GPU
 
acceleration,
 
and
 
one
 
song
 
will
 
be
 
processed
 
in
 
6-8
 
minutes
 
instead
 
of
 
~20
 
seconds.
 
  -  New  paid  drum  separation  service:  https://remuse.online/remusekit It  uses  free  drumsep model  (same  model  hash:  9C18131DA7368E3A76EF4A632CD11551)   -  MDX  Colab  seem  to  not  work  due  to  Numpy  issues.  I  already  fixed  them  in  Similarity  Colab,  and  hopefully  reimplement  the  fixes  elsewhere  soon.  VR  Colab fixed  too.   Tech  details  about  introduced  changes  described  below  Similary  Extractor section.   -  Music  AI surfaced.  Paid  -  $25  per  month  or  pay  as  you  go  (pricing  chart).  No  free  trial.  Good  selection  of  models  and  interesting  module  stacking feature.  To  upload  files  instead  of  using  URLs  “you  make  the  workflow,  and  you  start  a  job  from  the  main  page  using  that  
custom
 
workflow”

 Allegedly  it’s  made  by  Moises  team,  but  the  results  seem  to  be  better  than  those  on  Moises.  “Bass  was  a  fair  bit  better  than  Demucs  HT,  Drums  about  the  same.  Guitars  were  very  good  
though.
 
Vocal
 
was
 
almost
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
my
 
cleaned
 
up
 
work.
 
(...)
 
I'd
 
say
 
a
 
little
 
clearer
 
than
 
mvsep
 
4
 
ensemble.
 
It
 
seems
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
instrument
 
bleed
 
out
 
quite
 
well,

  -  “I  just  got  an  email  from  Myxt  saying  they're  going  to  limit  stem  creation  to  1  track  per  
month.
 
For
 
creator
 
plan
 
users
 
(the
 
$8
 
a
 
month
 
one)
 
and
 
2
 
per
 
month
 
for
 
the
 
highest
 
plan.
 So  I  may  assume  with  that  logic,  they're  gonna  take  it  away  for  free  users?”
