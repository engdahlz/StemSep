I
 
got
 
a
 
rude
 
awakening
 
lol”
 -  “That's  why  that  model  name  is  confusing,  lol.  What  they  mean  is  tubular  Bells  or  chimes.  
There's
 
currently
 
no
 
sleigh
 
bells
 
model,
 
but
 
the
 
Tambourine
 
model
 
may
 
work”
 -  “It  worked  (...)  I  used  drumsep  on  it  before”  “I  finally  was  able  to  extract  the  lead  guitar  in  this  song  using  the  dobro  model,  but  i  noticed  
how
 
the
 
bass
 
synth
 
is
 
leaking
 
in
 
the
 
dobro
 
stem”
 “So  I  thought,  what  if  I  just  remove  the  bass  in  the  source  and  try  again?  I  did,  and  now  it  
doesn't
 
pick
 
the
 
lead
 
guitar
 
anymore”
  -  (uvronline)  “Added  two  new  models:  BS-RoFormer  Kar  (anvuew)  De-reverb  Room  (anvuew)”  -  Aufr33  The  latter  is  also  added  to  the  Colab.   -  (MVSEP)  “We  added  MVSep  Synth  (synth,  other)  model.  Synth  is  included  the  following  
stems:

plucks.
 
But
 
it's
 
tricky
 
to
 
predict
 
what
 
it'll
 
do,
 
so
 
might
 
be
 
safer
 
to
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
the
 
other
 
stems
 
first,
 
and
 
then
 
using
 
synth
 
on
 
what's
 
left
 
if
 
you
 
need
 
further
 
separation.
 
Some
 
examples:
 It  isn't  picking  up  synth  basses  for  me,  so  use  BS-Roformer  SW  for  that.  It  also  sort  of  picks  up  synth  brass,  but  wind  model  is  catching  that  better,  at  least  on  the  
stuff
 
I
 
ran.
 
The
 
same
 
could
 
possibly
 
be
 
said
 
for
 
synth
 
guitars.”

 “I  tested  it  on  a  front  channel  rip  from  a  cue  from  the  TV  show  CHUCK,  and  it  ripped  the  
synth
 
lead.
 
But
 
it
 
did
 
not
 
isolate
 
the
 
synth
 
"effect"
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
it”

 “is  good,  but  sometimes  it  can't  detect  some  bass  synths  for  some  reason,  still  not  a  big  
problem
 
since
 
an
 
SW
 
does
 
the
 
work
 
almost
 
every
 
time.
 
And
 
sometimes
 
it
 
picks
 
the
 
strumming
 
of
 
guitars.
 
And
 
also
 
it
 
seems
 
to
 
fail
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
vocals
 
or
 
harmonies.”

 “Most  of  the  time  gets  more  out  of  the  song  rather  than  taking  out  guitar,  keys,  bass  
separately
 
until
 
synths
 
are
 
left
 
over.
 
Sometimes
 
very
 
few
 
misses
 
or
 
stem
 
bleeds
 
through,
 
but
 
overall
 
very
 
impressive!!
 
It
 
also
 
picks
 
up
 
Vibraphone”

 “Synth  stem  seems  way  too  muddy  on  full  songs,  (...)  But  much  better  than  I  was  expecting,  
I'll
 
be
 
honest.
 
It
 
messes
 
up
 
a
 
lot
 
on
 
full
 
songs,
 
it
 
seems.
 
It
 
seems
 
like
 
it's
 
more
 
like
 
a
 
stem
 
remover
 
than
 
an
 
isolator
 
to
 
me.
 
The
 
no
 
synth
 
stems
 
sounds
 
very
 
clean.
 
Tried
 
it
 
on
 
Dolby
 
stems,
 
same
 
thing,
 
the
 
no
 
synth
 
stem
 
was
 
very
 
clean,
 
synth
 
stem
 
sounded
 
a
 
bit
 
muddy
 
though.
 
That's
 
fine
 
though.
 
Gets
 
very
 
confused
 
with
 
bass
 
thought.
