     "It  is  based  on  v1e,  but  the  Fullness  is  not  as  high  as  v1e,  so  it  is  positioned  as  an  improved  
version
 
of
 
v1."

  "very  nice  model,  the  multistft  noise  is  gone"  It's  probably  due  to:  "Unwrapped  phase  loss  function  added"  Unwa  BTW.  It  was  already  proven  before,  that  adding  artificial  noise  to  separations  was  increasing  
fullness
 
metric.
  "Seems  to  have  significantly  less  sax  and  harmonica  bleed  in  vocal,  which  is  an  awesome  
thing
 
(...)
 
It
 
still
 
struggles
 
with
 
other
 
things
 
like
 
FX
 
and
 
Kazoo."

 "It  sounds  clean.  The  only  thing  [is]  that  some  instruments  are  deleted,  and  in  some  tracks  
leaves
 
remnants
 
of
 
voice
 
in
 
the
 
instrumental."

 "Screams  are  not  removed  from  the  track"  Halif   Training  details   "I  made  a  small  improvement  to  the  dataset  and  trained  about  50k  steps  with  a  batch  size  of  
2.
  8192  was  added  to  multi_stft_resolutions_window_sizes.  As  it  was,  the  memory  usage  increased  too  much,  so  it  was  rewritten  to  use  hop_length  =  
147
 
when
 
window_size
 
is
 
4096
 
or
 
less
 
and
 
441
 
when
 
window_size
 
is
 
greater
 
than
 
that."

  -  Mesk  released  a  preview  of  his  instrumental  model  retrained  from  Mel  Kim  on  metal  
dataset
 
consisting
 
of
 
a
 
few
 
thousands
 
of
 
songs.
 https://huggingface.co/meskvlla33/metal_roformer_preview/tree/main |  Colab These  are  not  multisong  metrics,  but  made  with  private  dataset!  Instr  bleedless:  48.81,  fullness:  42.85,  SDR:  13.7621   "currently  restarting  from  scratch  because  I  think  I  know  what  all  the  problematic  vocal  tracks  
were,
 
and
 
I
 
removed
 
them,
 
we'll

it's

better"
  "vocals  could  follow  if  requested.  Should  work  fine  for  all  genres  of  metal,  but  doesn't  work  on:  -  hard  compressed  screams  -  some  background  vocals  -  weird  tracks  (think  Meshuggah's  "The  Ayahuasca  Experience")   P.S:  Use  the  training  repo  (MSST) if  you  want  to  [separate]  with  it.  UVR  will  be  abysmally  slow  (because  of  chunk_size  [introduced  since  UVR  Roformer  beta #3])”
