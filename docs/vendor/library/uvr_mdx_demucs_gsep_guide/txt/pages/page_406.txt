models)
 Copy  model  file  to:  Gdrive\MDX_Colab\onnx\MDX-UVR  Ins  Model  Full  Band  450  (HQ_1)\”  as  in  the  link  
below,
 
and
 
replace
 
models.py
 
in
 
Gdrive\MDX_Colab
 
(if
 
you
 
didn’t
 
already
 
for
 
full
 
band
 
models)
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/126ErYgKw7DwCl07WprAXWPD_uX6hUz-e?usp=sharing 13)  From  now  on,  you’re  forced  to  run  separately  newly  added  torch  cell  to  fix  PyTorch  
issues
 14)  Newer  full  band  498/HQ_2  model  (with  the  same  modified  models.py  for  the  full  band  
models)
 Copy  model  file  to:  Gdrive\MDX_Colab\onnx\MDX-UVR  Ins  Model  Full  Band  498  (HQ_2)\”  as  in  the  link  
below,
 
and
 
replace
 
models.py
 
in
 
Gdrive\MDX_Colab
 
(if
 
you
 
didn’t
 
already
 
for
 
full
 
band
 
models)
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O5b-uBbRTn_A9B2QkefklCT41YR9voMq?usp=sharing 15)  For  full  band  models,  use  only  modified  models.py  attached  above,  or  you’ll  get  cutoff  
at
 
14.7kHz
 
instead
 
of
 
22kHz
 
in
 
spectrograms
 
while
 
using
 
427
 
models.py
 
file.
 16)  For  Kim  other  FT  instrumental  model  with  cutoff  but  the  highest  SDR  (even  than  
inst3)
 Copy  both  (vocals  and  other)  model  files  to:  Gdrive\MDX_Colab\onnx\Kim  ft  other  instrumental  model\”  as  in  the  link  below,  and  
replace
 
models.py
 
in
 
Gdrive\MDX_Colab
 
(if
 
you
 
didn’t
 
already
 
for
 
full
 
band
 
models)
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v2Hy4AgFOJ9KysebGuOgn0rIveu510j6?usp=sharing (it  will  give  only  1  stem  output,  models  duplicated  fixes  errors  in  Colab,  models.py  is  from  inst3  model)  17)  If  you  use  models.py  from  fullband  model,  it  will  output  fullband  for  ft  other  model,  but  
giving
 
much
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
(but
 
it
 
still
 
might
 
be
 
even
 
better
 
in
 
some
 
busy
 
mix
 
parts
 
than
 
VR
 
models,
 
while
 
having
 
still
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues
 
only
 
in
 
those
 
busy
 
parts
 
like
 
chorus)
 
-
 
definitely
 
use
 
min_mag
 
here.
 18)  To  fix  the  following  error,  make  sure  both  vocals  and  invert  vocals  are  always  
checked:
 shell-init:  error  retrieving  current  directory:  getcwd:  cannot  access  parent  directories:  
No
 
such
 
file
 
or
 
directory
 Intel  MKL  FATAL  ERROR:  Cannot  load  
/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/torch/lib/libtorch_cpu.so.
 Above  error  can  also  mean  you  need  to  terminate  your  session  and  start  over.  It  
randomly
 
happens
 
after
 
using
 
the
 
Colab:
 19)  I've  reverted  old  "Karokee"  and  "Karokee_AGGR"  models  to  use  with  the  oldest  HV’s  models.py file,  but  these  are  old  models  (maybe  they  will  do  the  trick,  though).
