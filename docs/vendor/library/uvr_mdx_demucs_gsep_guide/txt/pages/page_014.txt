    “it  does  have  significant  synth  bleed,  too...    it  at  least  wasn't  coming  through  at  full  volume  when  I  say  fullness,  I  specifically  mean  how  muddy  it  sounds”  -  Raiboom  Dash   -  Anvuew  released  a  new  Karaoke  BS-Roformer  model  https://huggingface.co/anvuew/karaoke_bs_roformer https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/9180 UVR  users  will  encounter  “ModuleNotFoundError:  "No  module  named  'torch._dynamo.polyfills.fx'"  with  this  model  (consider  MSST instead).  Maybe  users  of  RTX  5000  won’t  encounter  that  issue  due  to  newer  PyTorch  in  dedicated  patch.  Sadly  not  -  even  
with
 
CPU
 
only.
 
Even
 
more,
 
the
 
issue
 
seems
 
to
 
exist
 
only
 
on
 
RTX
 
5000
 
patch.
  “karaoke  anvuew  extracts  lead  vocals  a  bit  better  than  karaoke  becruily  frazer,  and  in  some  
parts,
 
the
 
lead
 
vocals
 
from
 
karaoke
 
anvuew
 
still
 
sound
 
brighter
 
compared
 
to
 
karaoke
 
becruily
 
frazer,
 
which
 
sounds
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
compressed.
 
oh,
 
and
 
for
 
some
 
reason,
 
the
 
becruily
 
frazer
 
model
 
doesn’t
 
detect
 
vocals
 
with
 
radio
 
effects,
 
while
 
anvuew’s
 
model
 
handles
 
them
 
just
 
fine”

 “lead  vocals  leak  into  instrumental  (...)  Mel  Becruily  and  Frazer’s  BS  don’t  have  this  problem”  In  that  case,  maybe  “isolate  the  acapella  first  in  almost  all  cases  of  using  a  karaoke  model”  Demo:  https://pillows.su/f/671f60ffdd615eb2613c78dca70319fe https://pillows.su/f/391ec7ba8353a086989c9c0934321260”   -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  a  new  DeReverb  model  https://huggingface.co/anvuew/dereverb_room by  avuew.  It's  available  in  Reverb  Removal  (noreverb)  [by  choosing]  DeReverb  room  by  
anvuew
 
(BSRoformer).
 
It
 
works
 
only
 
for
 
vocals.
 
Since
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
mono
 
model,
 
it
 
processes
 
2
 
stereo
 
channels
 
independently.”

 Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251017064532-53be20aa17-10seconds-song.wav  -  (MVSEP)  Four  new  models  have  been  added:  1)  MVSep  Tambourine  (tambourine,  other).  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251015221411-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 2)  MVSep  Oboe  (oboe,  other).  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251015221618-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 3)  MVSep  Clarinet  (clarinet,  other).  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251015221718-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 4)  MVSep  Digital  Piano  (digital-piano,  other).  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251015221944-f0bb276157-mixture.wav  Sometimes  it  can  also  work  better  for  normal  piano  and  make  even  better  work  then  SW  if  it  
works.
 “Absolutely  fantastic  for  an  epiano.  i  just  put  your  example  song  through  mvsep  with  the  bs  
sw
 
piano
 
model
 
as
 
a
 
comparison
 
and
 
bs
 
sw
 
did
 
terribly.
 
Ofc
 
your
 
epiano
 
model
 
picked
 
up
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
epiano
 
in
 
a
 
clean
 
way”
