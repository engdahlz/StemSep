    (x)  BL-Rebalance  “The  most  important  thing  which  is  the  separation  quality,  is  horrible  unfortunately,  dialing  the  
vocals
 
all
 
the
 
way
 
down
 
to
 
-120db
 
the
 
max,
 
barely
 
picks
 
up
 
vocals
 
to
 
cancel,
 
the
 
song
 
sounds
 
like
 
it's
 
just
 
playing
 
normally
 
with
 
vocals
 
being
 
suppressed
 
in
 
a
 
very
 
horrible
 
way,
 
it's
 
muddy,
 
and
 
it
 
leaves
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
bleed,
 
also
 
again,
 
when
 
vocals
 
are
 
quite
 
loud,
 
you
 
barely
 
hear
 
anything
 
else
 
because
 
it's
 
fighting
 
hard.”
