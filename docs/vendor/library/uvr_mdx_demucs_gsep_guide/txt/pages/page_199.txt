“Clarity
 
and
 
fullness”
 
-
 
even
 
compared
 
to
 
newer
 
models
 
above.
 Beta  1/2  were  more  muddy  than  Kim’s  Roformer,  potentially  a  bit  less  of  residues,  a  bit  more  
artificial
 
sound.

and
 
later.
 
It’s
 
good
 
for
 
RVC
 
(and
 
favourite
 
codename’s
 
public
 
model
 
for
 
RVC
 
before
 
voc_fv4
 
was
 
released).

   Bleedless  models  #2   -  BS-Roformer  Revive  unwa’s  vocal  model experimental  |  yaml  (viperx  1297  model  fine-tuned)   Voc.  bleedless:  38.80,  fullness:  15.48,  SDR:  11.03  “Less  instrument  bleed  in  vocal  track  compared  to  BS  1296/1297”  but  it  still  has  many  issues,  “has  fewer  problems  with  instruments  bleeding  it  seems  compared  to  Mel.  (...)  1297  had  very  few  instrument  bleeding  in  vocal,  and  that  Revive  model  is  even  better  at  this.  Works  great  as  a  phase  fixer  reference  to  remove  Mel  Roformer  inst  models  noise”  (dca)   -  SYHFT  V5  Beta  -  only  on  x-minus/uvronline  (still  available  only  with  this link  for  premium  users,  and  for  free)  Vocal  bleedless:  37.27,  fullness,  16.18,  SDR:  10.82    Other  models  #2   -  Unwa’s  Kim  Mel-Band  Roformer  FT2  |  model |  Colab Vocals  bleedless:  37.06,  fullness:  16.61  (fullness  worse  vs  the  previous  FT,  but  both  metrics  
are
 
better
 
than
 
Kim’s)
 
It
 
tends
 
to
 
muddy
 
instrumental
 
outputs
 
at
 
times,
 
similarly
 
like
 
the
 
OG
 
Kim’s
 
model
 
was
 
doing,
 which  didn’t  happen  in  the  previous  FT  below.  Metrics  -  Unwa  Kim  Mel-Band  Roformer  FT3  Preview  |  model |  yaml |  Colab |  uvronline  via  special  link  for:  free/premium (scroll  down)  Vocal  bleedless:  36.11,  fullness:  16.80,  SDR:  11.05  “primarily  aimed  at  reducing  leakage  of  wind  instruments  to  vocals.”  For  now,  FT2  has  less  leakage  for  some  songs  (maybe  till  the  next  FT  will  be  released)   -  Unwa’s  Mel  Big  Beta  6  vocal  model |  yaml |  Colab |  Huggingface /  2 |  AI  Hub  Colab Similar  to  FT  series.  “Although  it  belongs  to  the  Big  series,  the  characteristics  of  the  model  
are
 
similar
 
to
 
those
 
of
 
the
 
FT
 
series.
 
(...)
 
this
 
model
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
FT2
 
bleedless
 
with
 
the
 
dim
 
increased
 
to
 
512”.
 Muddier  than  Big  Beta  5[e],  might  be  better  than  FT2  at  times.  
“If
 
you
 
liked
 
the
 
output
 
of
 
the
 
Big
 
Beta
 
5e
 
model,
 
you
 
may
 
not
 
like

as
 
much;
 
it
 
does
 
not
