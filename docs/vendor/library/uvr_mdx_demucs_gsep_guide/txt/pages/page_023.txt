     -  BS-Roformer  Karaoke  model by  becruily  &  frazer  released  |  MVSEP  |  uvronline  Metrics better  than  even  fused  model  gabox  +  aufr33/viperx  and  SCNet  IHF  below).  Make  sure  you  don’t  have  the  option  “Vocals  only”  checked  in  UVR.  “After  dozens  of  tests  I  can  tell  this  (...)  is  the  best  (better  harmony  detection,  better  
differentiation
 
between
 
LVs
 
and
 
BVs,
 
sounds
 
fuller,
 
less
 
background
 
roformer
 
bleed,
 
better
 
uncommon
 
panning
 
handling
 
etc)”

 “it  also  can  detect  the  double  vocals”  -  black_as_night  It  works  the  best  for  some  previously  difficult  songs.  Aufr33  and  viperx  model  seems  more  
consistent,
 
but
 
the
 
new
 
BS
 
is
 
still
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
overall

 “my  og  Mel  also  catches  some  of  the  FX/drums,  I  guess  quite  a  difficult  one  due  to  how  it’s  
mixed”

 “it  does  do  better  on  mono  than  previous  sometimes  confuses  which  voice  should  be  the  lead,  but  all  models  do  that  on  mono  in  the  
exact
 
use-case
 
I
 
normally
 
test”

 “In  my  opinion,  this  model  is  in  no  way  inferior  to  the  ViperX  (Play  da  Segunda)  —  it's  really  
very
 
good.
 
(...)
 
I
 
noticed
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
separation,
 
the
 
first
 
voice
 
still
 
appears
 
mixed
 
with
 
the
 
second.
 
The
 
second
 
voice,
 
however,
 
stands
 
out
 
more,
 
but
 
not
 
completely
 
isolated—in
 
some
 
passages,
 
it
 
still
 
appears
 
alongside
 
the
 
first.
 
In
 
short:
 
the
 
model
 
better
 
separates
 
the
 
second
 
voice,
 
but
 
still
 
presents
 
some
 
mixing
 
between
 
them.”

 “The  new  karaoke  model  doesn't  actually  differentiate  between  lvs  &  bvs  and  there's  some  
lead
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
in
 
the
 
instrumental
 
stem”

 Fixes  and  expansion  to  the  dataset  and  retrain  of  the  model  possible  in  the  future.  “The  dataset  isn't  correctly  labelled,  so  in  some  training  examples  it  was  literally  training  the  
model
 
to
 
treat
 
the
 
backing
 
vocal
 
as
 
the
 
lead”

 VS  the  newer  BS-Roformer  MVSEP  team  model  above:  “sound  isn't  as  clear,  but  it  does  an  
infinitely
 
better
 
job
 
at
 
telling
 
lead/BGV
 
apart”
 Becruily:  “I  want  to  remind  something  regarding  my  (and  the  frazer)  models  they're  made  to  separate  true  lead  vocals,  meaning  either  all  of  the  main  singer's  vocals,  or  if  
it's
 
multiple
 
singers
 
-
 
theirs
 
too
 this  means  if  the  main  singer  has  stuff  like  adlibs  on  top  of  the  main  vocals,  these  are  
considered
 
lead
 
vocals
 
too
 
-
 
they
 
go
 
together
 if  there  are  multiple  singers  singing  on  top  of  each  other,  including  harmonise  each  other,  
and
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
additional
 
background
 
vocals
 
behind
 
those
 
-
 
all
 
the
 
singers
 
will
 
be
 
separated
 
as
 
one
 
main
 
lead
 
vocal,
 
leaving
 
only
 
the
 
true
 
background
 
vocals”
  think  of  them  like  concert  ready  models  -  the  output  instrumentals  will  be  ready  to  play  in  
cases
 
where
 
all
 
main
 
vocalists
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
sing
 
on
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
karaoke
 
instrumental
  ps:  and  yes,  double/stereo  lead  vocals  are  still  lead  vocals,  they're  not  bgvs  (only  in  rare  
cases)
