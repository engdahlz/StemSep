    if  vocals  lose  much  more  clarity  than  beat  in  the  mixture  once  you  compress  it  to  e.g.  mp3  
VBR
 
V0
 
(19kHz
 
cutoff)
 
or
 
lower.
  63.  Refrain  from  excessively  stacking  models  (e.g.  for  RVC)   “Inst  Voc,  Kim  Vocals,  Denoise,  ensemble  mode,  and  so  forth  can  introduce  noises  to  your  
dataset
 
as
 
it
 
rips
 
away
 
frequencies
 
from
 
your
 
audio.
 
This
 
harms
 
the
 
model
 
fidelity
 
and
 quality.”  more  64.  Get  cleaner  vocals  with  vocal  and  instrumental  model  mixdown  (e.g.  of  Mel  becruily  models)  by  Havoc/mrmason347   
Separate
 
with
 
becruily
 
Mel
 
Vocal
 
model
 
and
 
its
 
instrumental
 
model
 
variant,
 
then
 
get
 
vocals
 
from
 
the
 
vocal
 
model,
 
and
 
instrumental
 
from
 
instrumental
 
model,
 
import
 
both
 
stems
 
for
 
the
 
DAW
 
of
 
your
 
choice
 
(can
 
be
 
Audacity)
 
so
 
you’ll
 
get
 
a
 
file
 
sounding
 
like
 
original
 
file,
 
then
 
export
 
-
 
perform
 
a
 
mixdown
 
of
 
both
 
stems,
 
then
 
separate
 
it
 
with

  65.  Less  vocal  bleed  with  dim_t  256  or  corresponding  chunk_size (cypha_sarin)   
Small

  66.  If  you  set  24-bit  output  in  UVR>Options>Additional  settings  (or  ev.  64-bit)  for  e.g.  
demudder,
 
the
 
results
 
might
 
be
 
slightly
 
less
 
muddy
  67.  Clean  loop  of  the  instrumental  used  for  Matechering  and  full  separation   You  can  use  well  sounding  fragment  of  single  instrumental  model  separation  with  high  fullness  metric  as  a  reference  for  Matchering  in  UVR  for  phase-fixed muddy  result  set  as  target.  It  will  have  less  bleeding  than  models  with  low  bleedless  metric,  but  still  fuller  than  
phase-fixed
 
results.
  68.  chunk_size  112455  and  overlap  50   To  have  the  best  SDR  for  Roformers,  use  chunks  not  lower  than  11s,  which  is  usually  
training
 
chunks
 
value
 
(rarely
 
higher).
 
Although,
 
at
 
times
 
people
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
with
 
2,55s
 
chunks
 
(called
 
chunk_size
 
112455
 
since
 
UVR
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
#3).
 
But
 
be
 
aware
 
that
 
e.g.
 
using
 
becruily
 
Karaoke
 
model,
 
using
 
low
 
2,55s
 
chunk
 
will
 
lead
 
to
 
crossbleeding.
 
dim_t
 
to
 chunk_size  conversion  is  later  here.  Sometimes  even  go  to  extremes  and  use  e.g.  overlap  50  claiming  that  it  was  better  with  112455  and  becruily  inst  model  (thx  gustownis)   69.  If  you  want  smoother  vocals  from  e.g.  Beta  5e,  use  negative  values  of  Shift  Pitch  
Conversion
 
in
 
UVR
 
Advanced
 
MDX-Net
 
settings
 
(explained
 
more
 
thoroughly
 
above).
