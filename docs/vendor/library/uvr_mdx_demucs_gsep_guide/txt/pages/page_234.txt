 “Seems  very  picky  with  audio,  most  of  the  songs/files  I  tried  didn't  work  MedleyVox  works  on  the  other  side  (regardless  that  it's  of  lower  quality)”  -  becruily  -  MVSEP  Male/Female:  a)  Mel-Roformer  Male/Female  separation  model  13.03  SDR  a)  SCNet  XL  Male/Female  separation  model  on  MVSEP  (same  model  base)  SDR  on  the  same  dataset:  11.8346  vs  6.5259  (Sucial)  Sometimes  the  old  Sucial  model  might  still  do  a  better  job  at  times,  so  feel  free  to  
experiment.
