    crash  with  GPU  processing).  It’s  very  fast  for  the  latest  MDX23C  fullband  model  -  11  minutes  
vs
 
1
 
hour
 
on
 
CPU
 
previously.

 “one  annoying  thing  is  that  is  always  converts  the  output  to  mono  28k”   -  Separation  times  since  the  UVR  5.6  update  increased  double  for  some  people.  Almost  the  
same
 
goes
 
to
 
RAM
 
usage.
 
 Having  lots  of  space  on  your  system  disk  or  additional  partition  assigned  for  pagefile  can  be  
vital
 
in
 
fixing
 
some
 
crashes,
 
especially
 
for
 
long
 
tracks.
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
CPU
 
processing
 
tends
 
to
 
crash
 
less,
 
but
 
it's
 
much
 
slower
 
in
 
most
 
cases.
 "I  realized  that  with  2-3h  long  audio  files,  I  was  able  to  use  Demucs,  after  I  added  another  
32GB
 
of
 
RAM.
 
In
 
Total
 
my
 
system
 
got
 
64GB
 
and
 
I
 
increased
 
the
 
swap
 
file
 
to
 
128GB,
 
which
 
is
 
located
 
on
 
an
 
NVME
 
drive....
 
so
 
just
 
in
 
case
 
the
 
64GB
 
RAM
 
are
 
not
 
enough,
 
which
 
I
 
experienced
 
with
 
the
 
"Winds"
 
model,
 
it's
 
not
 
crashing
 
UVR,
 
instead
 
using
 
the
 
swap."
  -  Segments  set  to  default  256  instead  of  512  is  ⅓  faster  for  the  new  MDX23C  fullband  model  
at
 
least
 
for
 
4GB
 
cards.
 
But
 
it's
 
still
 
very
 
slow
 
on
 
such

  -  Sometimes  inverting  vocals  with  mixture  using  MDX23C  instead  of  using  instrumental  
output
 
can
 
give
 
better
 
results
 
and
 
vice
 
versa.
 “Differences  were  more  significant  with  D1581  [than  fullband],  but  secondary  vocals  stem  has  "a  bit"  higher  score”  (click).  Generally  inversion  of  these  MDX23C  models  (but  not  spectral)  was  giving  sometimes  better  results.   -  MedleyVox  Colab preconfigured  to  use  with  Cyrus  model   Newer  model  epochs  can  be  found  here:  https://huggingface.co/Cyru5/MedleyVox/tree/main  Q:  What  is  isrnet?  A:  It's  basically  just  another  model  that  builds  on  top  of  what  I've  built  so  far  that  performs  
better.
 
That's
 
the
 
surface
 
level
 
explanation,
 
at
 
least.
