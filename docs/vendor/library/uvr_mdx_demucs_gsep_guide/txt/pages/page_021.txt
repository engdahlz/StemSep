    -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  new  Karaoke  model:  "BS  Roformer  by  MVSep  Team  (SDR:  10.41)"  it's  available  under  option  "MVSep  MelBand  Karaoke  (lead/back  vocals)".  Metrics.  In  contrast  with  other  Karaoke  models,  it  returns  3  stems:  "lead",  "back"  and  "instrumental".  Example:  https://mvsep.com/result/20250915192251-53be20aa17-10seconds-song.wav”  -  ZFTurbo  “If  I  had  to  compare  it  to  any  of  the  models,  it  is  similar  to  the  frazer  and  becruily  model.  
Sometimes
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
detect
 
the
 
lead
 
vocals
 
specially
 
if
 
there's
 
some
 
heavy
 
hard
 
panning,
 
but
 
when
 
it
 
does,
 
there
 
is
 
almost
 
no
 
bleed,
 
and
 
it
 
works
 
very
 
well
 
with
 
heavy
 
harmonies
 
in
 
mono
 
from
 
what
 
I
 
tested.”

 “becruily  &  frazer  is  better  a  little  when  the  main  voice  is  stereo”  -  daylightgay  “On  tracks  I  tested,  harmony  preservation  was  better  in  becruily  &  frazer  (...)  the  new  model  
isn't
 
worse,
 
I
 
ended
 
up
 
finding
 
examples
 
like
 
Chan
 
Chan
 
by
 
Buena
 
Vista
 
Social
 
Club
 
or
 
The
 
Way
 
I
 
Are
 
by
 
Timbaland
 
where
 
it
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
previous
 
kar
 
model.
 
The
 
thing
 
is,
 
with
 
the
 
Kar
 
models,
 
it's
 
just
 
track
 
per
 
track.
 
Difficult
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
model
 
for
 
batch
 
processing
 
as
 
it's
 
really
 
different
 
from
 
one
 
track
 
to
 
another”

 “I  also  found  the  new  model  to  not  keep  some  BGVs,  mainly  mono/low  octave  ones,  despite  
higher
 
SDR”

 “I  think  I've  found  a  solution  for  people  who  don't  like  the  new  model.  If  you  put  an  audio  file  through  the  karaoke  model  and  then  put  the  lead  vocal  result  through  
that,
 
it
 
usually
 
picks
 
up
 
doubles.
 
 
Which
 
you
 
can
 
then
 
put
 
in
 
your
 
BGV
 
stem
 
if
 
you'd
 
like”

 “it's  definitely  not  as  good  as  the  one  by  frazer  and  becruily.  SDR  can  be  misleading  
sometimes”

 becruily  [“our  model]  uses  11.9  SDR  vocal  model  as  a  base”  ZFTurbo  “I  started  from  SW  weights”  “I've  had  fantastic  results  with  it  so  far.  Much  MUCH  better  at  holding  the  'S'  &  'T'  sounds  
than
 
the
 
Rofo
 
oke
 
(for
 
backing
 
vox).
 
Generally
 
seems
 
to
 
provide
 
fuller
 
results
 
..
 
but
 
also
 
the
 
typical
 
'ghost'
 
residue
 
from
 
the
 
main
 
vox
 
can
 
end
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
backing
 
vox
 
sometimes,
 
but
 
it's
 
usually
 
not
 
enough
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
issue.
 
I
 
won't
 
go
 
so
 
far
 
as
 
so
 
say
 
that
 
it's
 
replacing
 
the
 
other
 
backing
 
vox
 
models
 
for
 
me
 
entirely
 
..
 
but
 
it
 
feels
 
like
 
the
 
best
 
of
 
both
 
worlds
 
that
 
Rofo
 
and
 
UVR2
 
provide.”
