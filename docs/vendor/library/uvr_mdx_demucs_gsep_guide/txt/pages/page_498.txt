    “sometimes  rendering  into  9.1.6  is  good  for  some  instruments  yet  everyone  says  it’s  really  
unnecessary
 which  is  kinda  true  like  the  1-2  channel  for  9.1.6  dolby  is  insanely  clean  on  the  songs  i’ve  tried  but  some  other  
stems
 
sound
 
a
 
bit
 
ehh”

Isling
   -  from  Tidal  (via  Tidal-Media-Downloader-PRO  [Tidal-DL  GUI] )  (doesn’t  work  anymore  for  Atmos;  see  further  below)   Just  get  Tidal-dl  with  HiFi  Plus  subscription -  now  merged  into  one  subscription  (CLI  version;  for  one  user  on  our  server  it  works  for  13.10.22,  but  for  some  people  strangely  not).   For  30.04.24  with  Tidal  app  installed  on  Windows  and  tidal-gui  authorized  by  browser  
prompt/or
 
automatically,
 
Atmos
 
files
 
are
 
not
 
downloaded
 
(checked
 
all
 
qualities
 
in
 
settings
 
incl.
 
720/1080),
 
at
 
least
 
on
 
subscription
 
automatically
 
converted
 
into
 
higher
 
plan
 
due
 
to
 
recent
 
changes
 
(MQA
 
files
 
started
 
to
 
play
 
since
 
then,
 
so
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
subscription
 
issue).
  If  having  some  problems,  use  tidal-dl  (non-GUI)  and  tidal  account  with  valid  subscription  and  
proper
 
plan,
 
set
 
up
 
to
 
fire
 
tv
 
device
 
api
 
(option
 
5
 
iirc).
 But  I  cannot  guarantee  it  will  work  for  Atmos.   >  from  Tidal  (with  orpheus_dl_tidal installed  over  orpheusDL;  max  5.1[.4?])   Downloads  Atmos and  high  resolution files  bigger  than  24/48.  It’s  only  CLI  app  (valid  subscription is  still  required).  A  bit  convoluted  installation.   If  you  have  problem  with  using  git  in  the  Windows  command  line,  use  this ready  OrpheusDL  package  (works  for  30.04.24,  later  it  can  get  outdated;  it  already  has  Tidal  settings  and  
Atmos
 
enabled)
 
after
 
you
 
install
 
python-3.9.13
 
or
 
newer
 
(works
 
currently
 
also
 
on
 
python-3.12.3-amd64).
 
 Or  else,  to  install  manually  following  GH  instructions,  to  fix  git  issue,  execute:  pip  install  gitpython   and/or  install  git  from  here  (one  or  both  of  these  should  fix  using  git  in  CML  when  pip  install  git  cannot  find  supported  
distribution
 
and
 
git
 
command
 
is
 
not
 
recognized).
  Once  Python  and  the  OrpheusDL  package  is  correctly  installed,  CML  usage  is:   orpheus  https://tidal.com/browse/track/280733977   You  can  place  it  as  parameter  for  shortcut  to  orpheus.py  on  your  desktop  in  Target  (PPM  on  
shortcut).
 E.g.  "C:\Program  Files\OrpheusDL\orpheus.py"  https://tidal.com/browse/track/280733977
