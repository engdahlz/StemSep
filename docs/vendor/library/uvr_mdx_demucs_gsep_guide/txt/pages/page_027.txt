     -  We  have  the  first  lucky  person  on  the  server  who  succeeded  to  actually  use  the  new  
NVIDIA’s
 
upscaler,
 
and
 
their
 
messy
 
AF
 
code
 
on
 
Windows
 
using
 
Docker.
 The  output  is  mono,  so  you  need  to  process  each  channel  manually.  Also,  it's  extremely  slow,  even  on  4070  Super,  but  results  are  “impressive”.  More (don't  expect  step-by-step  tutorial  for  now  because  the  guy  is  “not  tech  support”).   -  Unwa  released  BS-Roformer-Inst-FNO model  (incompatible  with  UVR,  use  MSST and  read  special  model  installation  instruction  below).  inst.  bleedless:  42.87,  fullness:  32.03,  SDR:  17.60  “very  small  amount  of  noise  compared  to  other  fullness  inst  models,  while  keeping  enough  
fullness
 
IMO.
 
I
 
don't
 
even
 
know
 
if
 
phase
 
fix
 
is
 
needed.
 
Maybe
 
it's
 
still
 
needed
 
a
 
little
 
bit.”

 “seems  less  full  than  reserection,  which  I  would  expect  given  the  MVSEP  [metric]  results.  
(...)
 
I'd
 
say
 
it's
 
roughly
 
comparable
 
to
 
gabox
 
inst
 
v7”
 “I  replaced  the  MLP  of  the  BS-Roformer  mask  estimator  with  FNO1d  [Fourier  Neural  
Operator],
 
froze
 
everything
 
except
 
the
 
mask
 
estimator,
 
and
 
trained
 
it,
 
which
 
yielded
 
good
 
results.
 
(...)
 
While
 
MLP
 
is
 
a
 
universal
 
function
 
approximator,
 
FNO
 
learns
 
mappings
 
(operators)
 
on
 
function
 
spaces.”
 “(The  base  weight  is  Resurrection  Inst)”   Installing  the  model  -  instructions :  1.  For  Pytorch  newer  than  2.6,  replace  in  utils  folder  by  this  models_utils.py (neoculture),  or  edit  it  manually:  “I  had  many  errors  with  torch.load  and  load_state_dict,  but  I  managed  to  solve  them.

2.6
 
and
 
later

improved
 
security
 
when
 
loading
 
checkpoints,
 
which

the
