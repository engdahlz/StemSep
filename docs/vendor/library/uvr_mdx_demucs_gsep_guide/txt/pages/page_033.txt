    -  (MVSEP)  MelBand  Karaoke  (lead/back  vocals)  Gabox  model  added  (SDR:  9.67)  -  Fused  model  of  Gabox  and  Aufr33/viperx  weights  0.5  +  0.5  added  (SDR:  9.85)  
It
 
gives
 
maybe
 
only
 
slightly
 
worse
 
results
 
than
 
normal
 
ensembling,
 
but
 
with
 
separation
 
time
 
of
 
just
 
one
 
model
 
“it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
quality
 
and
 
definition
 
as
 
Gabox
 
Karaoke,
 
fused
 
doesn't
 
separate
 
well.”

 You  can  perform  fusion  of  models  using  ZFTurbo  script
(src)
 or  by  Sucial  script (they’re  similar  if  not  the  same).  “I  think  the  models  need  to  have  at  least  the  same  dim  and  depth  but  I'm  
not
 
sure
 
about
 
that”

 Despite  the  higher  SDR,  the  fusion  model  seems  to  confuse  lead/back  vocals  more.  -  The  same  goes  to  public  Karaoke  fusion  models  released  by  Gonzaluigi  here  -  Gabox  released  Mel-Roformer  voc_gabox2 vocal  model  |  yaml |  Colab Vocal  bleedless:  33.13,  fullness:  18.98,  SDR:  10.98   -  Unwa  released  a  BS-Roformer  vocal  model  called  "Resurrection"  |  yaml which  shares  some  similarities  with  the  SW  model  (might  be  a  retrain).  The  default  chunk_size  is  pretty  
big,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
memory,
 
decrease
 
it
 
to
 
e.g.
 
523776.
 Vocal  bleedless:  39.99,  fullness:  15.14,  SDR:  11.34.   "Omg,  this  model  is  doing  a  really  good  job  at  capturing  backing  vocals  (...)  Honestly,  it  sounds  a  bit  muddy,  and  there's  some  instrumental  bleeding  into  the  vocal  
stems"

 Not  so  good  for  speech  denoising  unlike  some  other  models  (Musicalman).   -  mesk’s  training  guide  updated  and  link changed   -  (MVSEP)  New  All-in  and  5  stem  ensembles  have  been  added  for  paid  users    -  AudioSR  WebUI  Colab by  Sir  Joseph  got  fixed   -  MVSep  Ensemble  11.93  (vocals,  instrum)  (2025.06.28)  added.  
Eventually
 
surpassed
 
sami-bytedance-v.1.1
 
on
 
the
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
SDR-wise.
 Instrumental  bleedless:  47.65,  fullness:  28.76,  SDR:  18.24  Vocal  bleedless:  36.30,  fullness:  17.73,  SDR:  11.93  -  corrected  typos  in  the  metrics  (thx  yakomotoo)   -  (MVSEP)  MultiChannel  now  uses  11.81  BS  Roformer  model.   -  (MVSEP)  New  BS  Roformer  model  is  now  available  on  site  -  it’s  called  2025.06  (don’t  
confuse
 
it
 
with
 
SW).
