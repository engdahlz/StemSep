    fast,  but  not  as  mdx_extra  (which  sounds  rather  lo-fi  in  that  case).

Bigger
 
“model2”
 
is
 
heavier
 
and
 
doesn’t
 
work
 
on
 
at
 
least
 
AMD
 
4GB
 
VRAM
 
GPUs
 
on
 
Beta
 
Roformer
 
patch
 
#2
 
(before
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
overlap
 
code).
 
 To  run  model1/2  in  UVR  “You  must  change  the  model  names  in  "mdx_C"  from  "ckpt"  [name]  
to
 
model1.ckpt,
 
model2.ckpt,
 
&
 
model3.ckpt.
 
[so
 
simply
 
add
 
the
 
name
 
to
 
the
 
extension]”
 
and
 
then
 
copy
 
the
 
ckpts
 
to
 
models\MDX-Net
 
without
 
yamls.
 
There
 
are
 
actually
 
3
 
mdx23c
 
models
 
there
 
(and
 
2
 
demucs),
 
but
 
model3
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
only
 
for
 
vocals
 
(and
 
with
 
low
 
SDR).
 
So
 
the
 
two
 
of
 
three
 
most
 
important
 
were
 
explained
 
above.
 OG  KUIELab’s  repo.   -  model_mdx23c_ep_168_sdr_7.0207 (4  stems)   Multisong  dataset  SDR  bass:  8.40,  drums:  7.73,  other:  4.57,  vocals:  7.36  
4
 
stems,
 
also
 
trained
 
on
 
MUSDB18HQ,
 
but
 
by
 
ZFTurbo,
 
it’s
 
different
 
from
 
the
 
above,
 
similar
 
size
 
to
 
“model2”.
 -  Aname  4  stem  BS-Roformer  model |  yaml Multisong  dataset  SDR  bass:  9.79,  drums:  10.21,  other:  5.27,  vocals:  9.13  It  has  better  SDR  than  the  7.0207  above  (as  in  the  SDR  metrics  link  below),  but  worse  than  
demucs_ft
 
and
 
BS-Roformer
 
4
 
stem
 
ZFTurbo
 
model
 
above.
 -  BS-RoFormer  4  stems  model  by  yukunelatyh  /  SYH99999  added  on  x-minus  https://uvronline.app/ai?discordtest Multisong  dataset  SDR  bass:  8.68,  drums:  10.37,  other:  5.05,  vocals:  8.57  
Some
 
people
 
like
 
it
 
more
 
than
 
Demucs,
 
but
 
“it's
 
like
 
demucs
 
v4
 
but
 
worse,
 
I
 
think.
 The  vocals  have  a  ton  of  bleed,  the  bass  is  disappointing  tbh.  The  other  stem  has  a  ton  of  bgv  and  adlib  bleed  in  it”  Isling  It  has  SDR  metrics for  all  stems  worse  than  4  stem  BS-Roformer  by  ZFTurbo  and  demuics_ft.  -  v2  of  it  was  added  on  site  with  lower  metrics  for  all  stems  in  later  period.   Smaller  public  4  stem  models  and  all  metrics:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/blob/main/docs/pretrained_models.md#multi-stem-models  -  GSEP  AI (2-4-6  stems,  sonically  it  used  to  have  the  best  other  stem  vs  Demucs,  also  piano  in  Demucs  is  worse,  and  it  picks  up  e-piano  more  frequently,  GSEP  electric  guitar  model  
doesn't
 
include
 
acoustic,
 
it's
 
only
 
electric).
 
In
 
general,
 
it
 
used
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
piano
 
model
 
before
 
many
 
alternatives
 
existed
 -  Ripple (defunct;  and  used  to  be  for  US  iOS,  at  one  point  best  SDR  for  all-in  one  single  4  stem  (besides  the  other  stem),  but  bad,  bleedy  other  stem.  Back  then  could  be  the  best  bass  
stem,
 
and/or
 
kick
 
in
 
drums,
 
but
 
not
 
the
 
best
 
drums
 
in
 
overall
 
vs
 
demucs_ft,
 
“you
 
need
 
something
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
drums
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
‘other’
 
stem
 
and
 
at
 
that
 
point
 
might
 
as
 
well
 
use
 
a
 
proper
 
drum
 
model”,
 
good
 
vocals.
 
You
 
can
 
minimize
 
residues
 
in
 
Ripple
 
by
 
providing
 
an
 
already
 
well
 
separated
 
instrumental
 
from
 
the
 
section
 
above,
 
and/or
 
minimizing
 
volume
 
of
 
the
 
input
 
file
 
by
 
3/6dB.
