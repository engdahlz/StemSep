    disconnected  from  runtime  when  the  notebook  is  idle  for  some  time  (it  can  even  freeze  in  the  
middle).
  In  reality,  Tesla  T4  maybe  has  much  more  memory,  but  what  takes  30  minutes  on  a  real  RTX  
3050,
 
here
 
might
 
take
 
even
 
more
 
than
 
2
 
hours
 
and
 
sometimes
 
slower
 
or
 
sometimes
 
slightly
 
faster
 
(usually
 
slower).
 
So
 
you're
 
warned.
  **Be  aware  that  these  4  model  ensemble  setting  with  both  500m  models  in  most  cases  won’t  
suffice
 
for
 
the
 
slowest
 
(and
 
no
 
longer
 
available
 
in
 
2023)
 
Tesla
 
K80
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
time
 
and
 
performance
 
limit
 
to
 
finish
 
such
 
a
 
long
 
operation
 
which
 
exceeds
 
2
 
hours
 
(it
 
takes
 
around
 
02:25h).
 
Certain
 
tasks
 
too
 
much
 
above
 
2
 
hours
 
ends
 
up
 
with
 
runtime
 
disconnection,
 
so
 
you're
 
warned.
  Also  be  aware  that  the  working  icon  of  Colab  on  the  opened  tab  sometimes  doesn’t  refresh  
when
 
operation
 
is
 
done.
 Furthermore,  it  can  happen  that  the  Colab  will  hang  near  01:45-02:17h  time  of  executing  the  
operation.
 
To
 
proceed,
 
you
 
can
 
click
 
F5
 
and
 
press
 
cancel
 
on
 
prompt
 
to
 
whether
 
to
 
refresh.
 
Now
 
the
 
site
 
will
 
be
 
functional
 
again,
 
but
 
the
 
process
 
will
 
stop
 
without
 
any
 
notice.
 
It
 
is
 
most
 
likely
 
the
 
same
 
case
 
when
 
you
 
suddenly
 
stop
 
connection
 
to
 
the
 
internet,
 
and
 
the
 
process
 
will
 
still
 
run
 
virtually
 
till
 
you
 
reconnect
 
to
 
the
 
session.
 
But
 
here,
 
you
 
just
 
don’t
 
have
 
to
 
click
 
the
 
reconnect
 
button
 
on
 
the
 
right
 
top.
 
Most
 
likely
 
you
 
have
 
very
 
limited
 
time
 
to
 
reestablish
 
the
 
connection
 
till
 
the
 
process
 
will
 
stop
 
permanently
 
if
 
you
 
don't
 
connect
 
on
 
connection
 
lost
 
(or
 
eventually
 
if
 
progress
 
tracker/Colab
 
will
 
stop
 
responding).
 
So
 
in
 
the
 
worst
 
case,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
observe
 
if
 
the
 
process
 
is
 
still
 
working
 
between
 
01:45-02:17h
 
of
 
processing.
 
If
 
you
 
see
 
that
 
your
 
GPU
 
has
 
0.84GB
 
instead
 
of
 
~2GB,
 
you’re
 
too
 
late
 
and
 
your
 
process
 
is
 
permanently
 
interrupted,
 
and
 
the
 
result
 
is
 
gone.
 
It’s
 
harder
 
to
 
track
 
how
 
long
 
it
 
processes
 
when
 
you
 
already
 
used
 
the
 
workaround
 
once,
 
and
 
the
 
timer
 
stopped,
 
so
 
you
 
don't
 
know
 
how
 
long
 
it
 
is
 
separating
 
already.
 Limit  for  faster  Tesla  T4  is  between  1:45  and  2:00h/+  (sometimes  2:25,  but  can  disconnect  
sooner,
 
so
 
try
 
not
 
to
 
exceed
 
two
 
hours)
 
of
 
constant
 
batch
 
operation,
 
which
 
suffice
 
for
 
2
 
tracks
 
being
 
isolated
 
using
 
ensemble
 
settings
 
above
 
with
 
both
 
500m
 
models
 
(rarely
 
3
 
tracks).
  HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_1  (9_HP2-UVR)  -  I  think  it  tends  to  give  the  most  
consistent
 
results
 
for
 
various
 
songs
 
(at
 
least
 
for
 
songs
 
when
 
vocal
 
residues
 
are
 
not
 
too
 
prevalent
 
here)
 HP-4BAND-V2_arch-124m  (2_HP-UVR)  -  much  faster  and  can  give  crisp  results,  but  with  
too
 
many
 
vocal
 
residues
 
for
 
some
 
songs
 
(like
 
VR
 
arch
 
generally
 
tends
 
to)
 HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m  (1_HP-UVR)  -  something  between  the  two  above,  and  can  
give
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
for
 
some
 
song
 
too
 
(out
 
of
 
other
 
VR
 
models)
 HP2-MAIN-MSB2-3BAND-3090_arch-500m  (7_HP2-UVR.pth)  -  tends  to  have  the  least  
vocal
 
residues
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
VR
 
models
 
listed
 
above,
 
but
 
in
 
cost
 
of
 
instrumentals
 
not
 
sounding
 
so
 
"full"
