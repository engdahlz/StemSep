    “using  500  on  both  parameters  really  does  make  me  have  the  illusion  that  I  have  produced  
the
 
official
 
instrumental.
 
Even
 
tho
 
it's
 
unofficial
 
haha”

  -  Deezer  on  Lucida  doesn’t  work.  Doubledouble.top  came  back  (probably  temporarily),  but  
returns
 
mp3
 
128kbps
 
from
 
Deezer
 
now.
 
Also,
 
it
 
supported
 
Apple
 
Music
 
unlike
 
Lucida,
 
but
 now  it  doesn’t  work,  (check  current  services  status).  Besides,  occasionally  it  can  happen  that  rips  from  Amazon  only  on  doubledouble  have  quality  higher  than  44/16.  Plus,  downloading  
full
 
albums
 
frequently
 
fails,
 
swhile
 
single
 
songs
 
downloading
 
works.
  -  Lots  of  new  Gabox  models  added  since  then,  including:   a)  BS-Roformer  instrumental  variant,  which  doesn’t  struggle  so  much  with  choirs  like  most  Mel-Roformers,  although  may  not  help  in  all  cases  (link)   b)  inst_gaboxFv3.ckpt -  like  v1e  when  it  comes  to  fullness  (added  on  x-minus)  Inst  SDR  16.43  |  inst.  fullness  38.71  |  inst.  bleedless  35.62  
It
 
might
 
pick
 
up
 
entire
 
sax
 
in
 
vocal
 
stem.
  -  Gabox  models  have  been  added  to  SESA  Colab (you’ll  find  more  info  about  them  later  below).    -  Along  with  UVR  Roformer  beta  patch  #14,  Anjok  released  the  long  anticipated  demudder .  
It's
 
in
 
Settings
 
>
 
Advanced
 
MDX
 
options
 
(so
 
works
 
only
 
for
 
Roformers
 
and
 
MDX
 
models).
 
It
 
consists
 
of
 
three
 
methods
 
to
 
choose
 
from
 
(each
 
separates
 
your
 
twice):
 
 -  Phase  Rotate  -  Phase  Remix  (Similar  to  X-Minus)  -  “the  fullest  sounding,  but  can  leave  a  lot  of  
artifacts
 
with
 
certain
 
models.
 
I
 
only
 
recommend
 
that
 
method
 
for
 
the
 
muddiest
 
models.
 
Otherwise,
 
Combined
 
Methods
 
is
 
the
 
best”
 
“I
 
don't
 
recommend
 
using
 
phase
 
remix
 
on
 
the
 
Instrumental
 
v1e
 
model.
 
I
 
recommend
 
combined
 
methods
 
or
 
phase
 
rotate
 
for
 
models
 
produce
 
fuller
 
instrumentals.”
 
Anjok
 
It
 
might
 
leave
 
some
 
choruses
 
when
 
using
 
V1E
 
(Fabio)
 -  Combine  Methods  (weighted  mix  of  the  final  instrumentals  generated  by  the  above).  More  in  the  full  changelog.  You  cannot  use  demudder  on  4GB  AMD  GPUs  with  800MB  Roformers  with  even  2  seconds  chunk  size  set  (memory  allocation  error).  “It's  meant  to  solely  target  instrumentals.  The  vocals  should  stay  exactly  as  before.  
For
 
Roformer
 
models,
 
it
 
must
 
detect
 
a
 
stem
 
called
 
"Instrumental”
 
so
 
for
 
some
 
models
 
like
 
Mel-Kim,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
open
 
model’s
 
corresponding
 
yaml,
 
and
 
change
 
“other”
 
to
 
“instrumental”.
  
“I've
 
noticed
 
with
 
the
 
few
 
amounts
 
of
 
tracks
 
I've
 
tried,
 
demudding
 
can
 
sometimes
 
accentuate
 
instances
 
of
 
bleeding
 
or
 
otherwise
 
entirely
 
missed
 
vocal-like
 
sounds”
  
In
 
case
 
of
 
file
 
not
 
found
 
error
 
on
 
attempt
 
of
 
using
 
demudder,
 
reinstall
 
UVR.
  “I  put  the  demudded  instrumental  in  the  bleed  suppressor,  and  it  sounds  really  good,  almost  
noise
 
free.
 
I
 
either
 
do
 
a
 
bleed
 
suppressor
 
or
 
a
 
V1/bleed
 
suppressor
 
ensemble”
