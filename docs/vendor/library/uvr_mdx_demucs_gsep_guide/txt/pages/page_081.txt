    Remover\torch_directml  and  replace  DirectML.dll  from  C:\Windows\System32\AMD\ANR  (make  backup  before).  Experimentally,  you  can  use  this  older  1.9.1.0 version  of  the  library.  Restart  UVR  after  replacing  the  file!   Be  aware  that  results  achieved  without  GPU  Conversion  that  way,  at  least  on  certain

  -  (uvronline.app)  Mel-Roformer  De-noise  released  for  premium  users.  “This  model  is  optimized  for  music  and  vocals.  You  can  choose  between  two  aggressiveness  
settings:
 minimum  -  removes  fewer  effects  such  as  thunder  rolls  average  -  usually  removes  more  noise”  “The  new  model  works  as  good  as  my  UVR  De-noise  model,  or  even  better.”   -  drumsep model  by  aufr33  and  jarredou  added  on  MVSEP and  uvronline.app too   -  Not  Eddy’s  multi-arch  Colab  released  in  form  of  UI  (like  in  e.g.  KaraFan)  https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eddycrack864/UVR5-UI/blob/main/UVR_UI.ipynb  In  case  of  “FileNotFoundError:  [Errno  2]”  try  other  location  than  “input”,  or  other  Google

  -  New  Mel-Roformer  de-reverb  model  by  anvuew  was  released  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/issues/1#issuecomment-2226805511 (to  make  it  work  with  UVR,  delete  “linear_transformer_depth:  0”  from  the  YAML  file,  copy  the  
model
 
to
 
MDX_Net_Models
 
and
 
YAML
 
config
 
to
 
model_data\mdx_c_configs)
 Also  added  on  MVSEP.   “I'm  definitely  hanging  onto  it.  It  reminds  me  of  the  equivalent  dereverb  mdx  model,  which  
I've
 
always
 
liked
 
(when
 
it
 
works).
 
The
 
roformer
 
model
 
is
 
cleaner
 
in
 
some
 
ways,
 
though
 
slightly
 
more
 
filtered
 
and
 
aggressive.
 Neither  the  roformer  or  mdx  models  respond  to  mono  reverb.  However,  adding  a  stereo  
reverb
 
on
 
top
 
solves
 
that,
 
especially
 
with
 
roformer.”
