some
 
musical
 
instruments.”
  -  New  4  stem  drumsep  SCNet  model  (kick,  snare,  toms,  cymbals)  has  been  added  on

“sound
 
is
 
good,
 
but
 
sometimes
 
some
 
instruments
 
are
 
lowered
 
or
 
deleted”
 
“while
 
the
 
annoying
 
buzzing/noise
 
is
 
still
 
present,
 
it
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
contained.”
  -  Gabox  released  Mel  KaraokeGabox model  (uses  Aufr’s  config)  |  Colab “the  lead  vocals  are  good  and  clean!   
While
 
the
 
backing
 
tracks
 
are
 
lossy
 
for
 
this
 
model,
 
[it
 
still]

 “The  model  doesn't  keep  the  backing  vocals  below  the  main  vocals,  sometimes  the  backing  
vocals
 
will
 
be
 
lost
 
even
 
though
 
there
 
are
 
backing
 
vocals
 
there.”
  -  New  FullnessVocalModel (yaml)  vocal  model  was  released  by  Aname  |  Colab Voc.  bleedless:  32.98  (less  than  beta  4),  fullness:  18.83  (less  than  big  beta  
5e/voc_fv4/becruily,
 
more
 
than
 
beta
 
4)
 “While  it  emphasizes  fullness,  the  noise  is  well-balanced  and  does  not  interfere  much.  (...)  in  sections  without  vocals,  faint,  rustling  vocals  can  be  heard.”  We  have  some  report  of  very  long  separation  of  this  model  in  UVR  on  Macs.  >  Try  to  change  chunk_size:  529200  to  112455  for  that  model/yaml  (but  it’s  dim_t  256  
equivalent,
 
so
 
something
 
higher

test
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
better
 
idea
 
too)
  -  (SESA)  No  audio  file  found  bug  fixed   -  “In  my  testing,  I've  found  that  SCNet  very  high  fullness  (on  mvsep)  put  through

Loving  this  model  so  far”  (mrmason347)  “lost  some  of  the  trumpet  sound   while  on  Becruily  model  can  keep  it,  but  some  also  was  
lost”
