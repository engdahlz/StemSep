    author  said  it  worked  as  expected  using  ZF  training  script  https://github.com/starrytong/SCNet/issues/1#issuecomment-2063025663)”   The  author:  “All  our  experiments  are  conducted  on  8  Nvidia  V100  GPUs.  When  training  solely  on  the  MUSDB18-HQ  dataset,  the  model  is  trained  for  130  epochs  with  the  Adam  [22]  optimizer  with  an  initial  learning  rate  of  5e-4  and  batch  size  of  4  for  each  GPU.  Nevertheless,  we  adjust  the  learning  rate  to  3e-4  when  introducing  additional  data  to  mitigate  potential  gradient  explosion.”   “Q:  So  that  mean  that  you  have  to  modulate  the  learning  rate  depending  on  the  size  of  the  
dataset
 
?
 I  think  it's  first  time  I  read  something  in  that  way  A:  Yea,  I  suppose  because  the  dataset  is  larger  you  need  to  ensure  the  model  sees  the  
whole
 
distribution
 
instead
 
of
 
just
 
learning
 
the
 
first
 
couple
 
of
 
batches”

 I  use  the  same  dataset  for  both  models  My  SCNet  large  stuck  at  SDR  9.1  for  vocals.  I  don't  know  why  My  small  SCNet  has  SDR  10.2  I  added  config  of  SCNet  to  train  on  MUSDB18:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/blob/main/configs/config_musdb18_scnet_large.yaml Only  changes  comparing  to  small  model  are  these  parts:   Small:  dims:      -  4      -  32      -  64      -  128  band_SR:      -  0.175      -  0.392
