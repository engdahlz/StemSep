    There  are  shorter  queues  for  single  model  separation  for  registered  users  with  at  least  one  point.  Possibly  shorter  queues  between  10:00  PM  -  1:00  AM  UTC.  The  ensemble  option  fixes  some  issues  with  general  muddiness  of  older  vocal  Roformer  models  (but  11.50  is  muddier  than  v.  
2.4
 
Colab).
  0)  KaraFan (e.g.  preset  5;  fork  of  original  ZFTurbo's  MDX23  fork  with  new  features  by  Captain  FLAM  with  jarredou's  help  on  some  tweaks),  offline  version,  org.  Colab and  Kubinka Colab  (older  version,  less  vocal  residues  vs.  v.3.1,  although  v.3.2-4.2/+  were  released  with  
fewer
 
residues).
 Used  to  be  one  of  the  best  free  solutions  for  instrumentals  (before  some  newer  Roformers  like  unwa’s  inst  v1 were  released),  with  not  big  amounts  of  vocal  residues  (sometimes  more  than  below),  and  clear  outputs.  But  no  4  stems  unlike  below:   0a)  MDX23  by  ZFTurbo  (weighted  UVR/ZF/VPR  models)  -  free  modified  Colab  fork  v.  2.1 -  2.4,  2.5 with  fixes  and  enhancements  by  jarredou  (one  of  the  best  SDR  scores  for  publicly  available  2-4  stem  separator,   v2.2.2 Colab  with  fullband  MDX23C  model  might  have  more  residues  in  instrumentals  vs  v.  2.1,  but  better  SDR,  2.7b (with  SCNet  XL,  not  SDR  evaluated  -  weight  set  by  ear),  2.3,  2.4  with  also  12xx  BS-Roformer,  v.  2.5  with  also  Kim’s  Mel-Roformer  (default  settings  can  be  already  good  and  balanced,  and  weights  further  adjusted,  read for  more  settings.   The  caveat  -  it  haven’t  been  updated  by  newer  Roformer  instrumental  models  at  the  top).    0a)  dango.ai  (tuanziai.com/en-US)  -  8$  every  10  songs,  currently  one  of  (if  not)  the  best  instrumental  separator  so  far;  at  least  till  unwa  inst  models  came  to  the  level  of  fullness  of  Dango  now  (you  might  
find
 
the
 
latter
 
even
 
too
 
muddy),
 
but
 
in
 
cost
 
of
 
more
 
noise,
 
although
 
“it
 
can
 
hande
 
complex
 
vocals/songs
 
well
 
so
 
it's
 
more
 
reliable,
 
and
 
no
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
in
 
background
 
of
 
instrumental”.
 
Dango’s

Conservative
 
mode
 
give
 
more
 
fullness
 
to
 
instrumentals
 
in
 
cost
 
of
 
whispering
 
artefacts
 
(experimental
 
for
 
the
 
time
 
being
 
-
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
Aggressive

and
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
fix
 
vocal
 
popping
 
using
 
Smart
 
Mode
 
(default).
