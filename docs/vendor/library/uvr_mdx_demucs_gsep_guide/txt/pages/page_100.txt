     Some  people  reported  that  following  the  steps  below  might  still  result  in  slow  separations:  Probably  you’ll  be  able  to  install  required  CUDA  12.8  and  nightly  PyTorch  to  fix  the  compatibility  issue  when  following  steps  for  manual  installation (unfold  it),  so  UVR  won't  use  its  own  Python  environment.  In  addition  to  the  above  link,  use  this repo  with  newer  code,  although  for  now,  not  the  newest  code  is  attached  from  the  patches  below...  and  all  if  you  fix  
"Getting

...
 
error"
 
afterwards.
 
Then
 
you’ll
 
have

-
 
then
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
use:
 python.exe  -m  pip  install  --upgrade  torch  --extra-index-url  
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
 instead  of  cu117  as  in  the  instruction  above  (although  for  RTX  5090  it  probably  won’t  work,  
and
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
 
instead.
 -  Similar  issue  might  occur  when  you  don’t  install  "onnxruntime-gpu"  when  the  current  is  "onnxruntime"  library  (which  does  not  support  GPU)  -  For  Demucs  UnpicklingError  issue  using  manual  installation:  modify  the  demucs/stats.py:  package  =  torch.load(path,  'cpu',  weights_only=False)  Sometimes  it  still  happens  for  e.g.  Becruily  inst  model  anyway.  It  can  be  the  indicator  that  the  
model
 
file
 
is
 
corrupted
 
and
 
has
 
wrong
 
CRC
 
(most
 
likely
 
wrongly

-
 
redownload
 
the
 
model.
 On  the  old  5.6.0  version,  there's  OpenCL  in  options  instead  of  DirectML  in  newer  patches  
(although
 
it's
 
the
 
latter).
 Alternatively,  you  can  use  MSST-GUI.  __________   -  Anjok  released  a  new  UVR  beta  Roformer  patch  #11  (Windows  only  for  now)  It  fixes  4  bugs:  with  VR  post-processing  threshold,  Segment  default  in  multi-arch  menu,

 The  issue  seems  to  occur  only  on  GTX  10XX  series,  and  maybe  older.
