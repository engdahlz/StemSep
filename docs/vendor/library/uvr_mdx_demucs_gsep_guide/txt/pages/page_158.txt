     -  Descriptions  on  the  list  of  models  are  usually  shortened  compared  to  the  news  section  information  
added
 
when
 
the
 
model
 
was
 
released.
 
You
 
can
 
use
 
search
 
with
 
the
 
model
 
name
 
for
 
more
 
possible
 
descriptions.
  -  Published  audio  demos  of  models  pasted  from  MVSEP  get  online  after  a  while,  so  most  links  to  
audio
 
files
 
from
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
offline
 
after
 
a
 
week
 
or
 
more.
  -  Without  GDoc  app  installed,  or  when  in  not  PC  mode  of  the  browser,  if  you  you  open  links  to  this  
document
 
ending
 
with
 
e.g.
 
“#heading=h.hk34hc4d1ah7”
 
or
 
similar,
 
you
 
won't
 
be
 
redirected
 
to
 
a
 
specific
 
section
 
of
 
this
 
document
 
referred
 
to
 
in
 
the
 
heading.
 
Redirections
 
from
 
such
 
links
 
doesn't
 
work
 
in
 
mobile
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
GDoc
 
site.
 To  be  redirected  after  a  moment  to  proper  section  from  outside  links  with  “heading”  in  the  URL,  you  
should
 
open
 
these
 
links
 
with
 
GDoc
 
app
 
installed,
 
or
 
on
 
PC
 
browser,
 
or
 
mobile
 
browser
 
with
 
PC
 
Mode
 
turned
 
on
 
(in
 
Chrome
 
that
 
option
 
appears
 
when
 
you
 
open
 
a
 
page
 
already).
  -  Sometimes  when  you  click  on  an  entry  in  the  document  outline,  it  might  not  react  the  first  time  
straight
 
up
 
after
 
you
 
load
 
the
 
document.
 
Most
 
likely
 
it's
 
still
 
loading
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
click
 
it
 
twice
 
or
 
more
 
and
 
then
 
you'll
 
be
 
redirected.
  -  Even  on  a  powerful  phone  with  lots  of  RAM,  GDoc  app  can  occasionally  crash,  esp.  while  browsing  
it
 
before
 
it’s
 
fully
 
loaded,
 
and
 
even
 
deleting
 
the
 
app
 
and
 
reopening
 
it
 
won’t
 
help.
  -  If  you  click  on  any  hotlink  redirecting  to  a  specific  part  of  this  document  from  the  mobile  version  of  
GDoc
 
in
 
the
 
browser,
 
you
 
won't
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
show
 
options
 
to
 
display
 
the
 
document
 
outline
 
after
 
switching
 
your
 
browser
 
into
 
PC
 
mode
 
-
 
it
 
will
 
remain
 
in
 
the
 
mobile
 
layout.
 
It's
 
because
 
redirections
 
in
 
mobile
 
versions
 
have
 
their
 
own
 
linking
 
scheme
 
adding
 
to
 
the
 
site
 
address
 
-
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
delete
 
its
 
ending
 
or
 
reopen
 
the
 
doc.

______________________________________________________________   Everyone  asks  which  service  and/or  model  is  the  best  for  instrumentals,  vocals  or  
stems
.
 
The
 
answer
 
is
 
-
 
we
 
have
 
listed
 
a
 
few
 
models
 
and
 
services
 
which
 
behave
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
most
 
cases,
 
but
 
the
 
truth
 
is
 
-
 
the
 
result
 
also
 
strictly
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
genre,
 
specific
 
song,
 
and
 
how
 
aggressive
 
and
 
heavily
 
processed
 
vocals
 
it
 
has.
 
Also,
 
how
 
much
 
distortion
 
instruments
 
have,
 
style
 
of
 
mixing,
 
etc.
 
Sometimes
 
one
 
specific
 
album
 
gets
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
with
 
one
 
specific
 
tool/AI/model,
 
but
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
some
 
exceptions
 
for
 
specific
 
songs,
 
so
 
just
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
experiment
 
with
 
each,
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
best
 
result
 
possible
 
using
 
various
 
models,
 
ensembles
 
and
 
services/AIs
 
from
 
those
 
listed.
 
SDR
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
doesn't
 
always
 
reflect
 
bleeding
 
well.
 
That’s
 
why
 
we
 
introduced
 
bleedless
 
and
 
fullness
 
metrics
 
for
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 models  as  well.  You’ll  read  more  about  it  in  this section.   _____________________  For  help  and  discussion,  visit  our  Audio  Separation  Discord:  https://discord.gg/ZPtAU5R6rP |  Download  UVR or MSST-GUI  For  inst/voc  separation  in  cloud,  try  out  free  Colabs:  BS/Mel-Roformer
