    -  RemFX for  detection  and  removal  of  the  following  effects:  chorus,  delay,  distortion,  dynamic  range  compression,  and  reverb.  Huggingface (currently  stopped  working)  |  Samples The  Colab is  slow  while  downloading  checkpoints from  zenodo  (400KB/s  for  1GB  file  out  of  6),  later  it  stopped  working.  Outputs  in  at  least  Huggingface  are  mono,  may  not  work  in  every  case,  the  website  in  
general
 
doesn't
 
work
 
well
 
with
 
big
 
files,
 
keep
 
them
 
short,
 
0-30
 
seconds.
 
Sometimes
 
30
 
seconds
 
is
 
still
 
not
 
enough
 
on
 
Colab
 
and
 
it
 
throws
 
OutOfMemoryError.
 It's  not  better  than  our  dereverb  model  in  UVR.  To  fix  Colab:  “speechbrain  lib  API  was  totally  changed  in  recent  1.0.0  version,  it's  working  if  you  
downgrade
 
it:
 
!pip
 
install
 
speechbrain==0.5.16”
