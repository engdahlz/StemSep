But  the  delivery  is  all  contained  within  12  channels  (7.1.4)   There  are  different  levels  of  MPEG-H.  For  streaming,  it's  7.1.4  which  is  level  3  IIRC.  Q:  3rd  order  Ambisonics  you  mean?  And  7.1.4  is  literally  just  Dolby,  right?  A:  No  7.1.4.  You  can  consider  it  the  same  as  Dolby  Atmos.  It's  object-based  audio,  Ambisonics  is  channel  based  audio.  Q:  Isn't  360  RA  Ambisonics  though?  Dolby  is  object  based,  right?  A:  Yep,  Dolby  and  Sony  360  are  object  based.  Sony  360  is  just  protected  MPEG-H  3D   Q:  So  Sony  360  is  also  object  based?  So  it's  not  Ambisonics  A:  [Sony  360  7.1.4  “decoded  to  normal  channel-based  audio”  looks  like  just  12  stems  which  
can
 
be
 
imported
 
into
 
Audacity]
 Q:  The  one  I  got  was  from  Amazon  Music,  not  Tidal.  Shouldn't  make  a  difference?  A:  It's  actually  far  more  powerful  than  Dolby  Atmos  in  this  sense.   Music  Media  Helper  can  decode  Sony  360.  Last  time  i  checked  they  are  possible  to  rip  from  
Tidal
 
although
 
iirc
 
Tidal
 
are
 
dropping
 
360
 
support?

Might  be  useful  even  for  enhancing  quality  of  instrumentals  after  separation  (or  your  own  
mixed
 
music)
  Be  aware  that  at  least  some  advanced  mixing  beforehand  may  cheat  the  content  ID

so
 
your
