    HighPrecison_4band_arch-124m_1  (I  think  not  available  in  UVR,  you'd  need  to  install  it  
manually)
 
-
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
companion
 
if
 
you
 
only
 
have
 
VR
 
models
 
for
 
ensemble
 HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_2  (9_HP2-UVR)  -  the  same  situation,  I  think  it  rarely  
gives
 
any
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
500m_1
 
(if
 
in
 
even
 
any
 
case)
 
but
 
it's
 
good
 
for
 
purely
 
VR
 
ensemble
   _______VR  algorithms  of  ensemble  _______   by  サ ナ (Hv#3868)  “np_min  takes  the  highest  value  out,  np_max  does  vice  versa  it's  also  similar  to  min_mag  and  max_mag   So  the  min_mag  is  better  for  instrumental  as  you  could  remove  artefacts.   comb_norm  simply  mixes  and  normalizes  the  tracks.  I  use  this  for  acapella  as  you  won't  lose  
any
 
data
 
this
 
way”
   Batch  conversion  on  UVR  Colab   There’s  a  “ConvertAll”  batch  option  available  in  Colab.  You  can  search  for  “idle  check”  in  this  
document
 
to
 
prevent
 
disconnections
 
on
 
long
 
Colab
 
sessions,
 
but
 
at
 
least
 
if
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
slowest
 
K80
 
GPU,
 
the
 
limit
 
is
 
currently
 
2
 
hours
 
of
 
constant
 
work,
 
and
 
it
 
simply
 
terminates
 
the
 
session
 
with
 
GPU
 
limit
 
error.
 
The
 
limit
 
is
 
enough
 
for
 
5
 
tracks
 
-
 
22
 
minutes
 
with
 
~+/-3m17s
 
overhead
 
(HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m/TTA/272ws/noppr/~2it/s)
 
so
 
better
 
execute
 
bigger
 
operations
 
in
 
smaller
 
instances
 
using
 
various
 
accounts
 
and/or
 
after
 
3-5
 
attempts
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
finally
 
hit
 
on
 
better
 
GPU
 
than
 
K80.
 
 To  get  faster  GPU  simply  go  to  Runtime>Manage  session>Close  and  connect  and  execute  
Colab
 
till
 
you
 
get
 
faster
 
Tesla
 
T4
 
(up
 
to
 
5
 
times).
 
But
 
be
 
aware,
 
that
 
5
 
reconnections
 
will
 
reach
 
the
 
limit
 
on
 
your
 
account,
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
change
 
it.
 
It’s
 
easier
 
to
 
get
 
T4
 
and
 
not
 
reach
 
the
 
limit
 
reconnecting,
 
around
 
12:00
 
CET
 
in
 
working
 
days.
 
14:30
 
o’clock
 
it
 
was
 
impossible
 
to
 
get
 
T4,
 
but
 
probably
 
it
 
depended
 
on
 
a
 
situation
 
when
 
I
 
already
 
used
 
T4
 
this
 
day
 
since
 
I
 
received
 
it
 
immediately
 
on
 
another
 
account.
 For  single  files  isolation  instead  of  batch  convert  I  think  it  took  me  6-7  hours  till  the  GPU  limit  
was
 
reached,
 
and
 
I
 
processed
 
19
 
tracks
 
using
 
272
 
ws
 
in
 
that
 
session.
 JFI:  Even  5800X  is  slower  than  the  slowest  Colab  GPU.   Shared  UVR  installation  folder  among  various  Google  accounts   Since  we  no  longer  can  use  old  Gdrive  mounting  method  allowing  mounting  the  same  drive  
across
 
various
 
Colab
 
sessions
 
-
 
to
 
not
 
clutter
 
all
 
of
 
your
 
accounts
 
by
 
UVR
 
installation,
 
simply
 
share
 
a
 
folder
 
with
 
editing
 
privileges
 
and
 
create
 
a
 
shortcut
 
from
 
it
 
to
 
your
 
new
 
account.
 
Sadly
 
the
 
trick
 
will
 
work
 
for
 
one
 
session
 
at
 
a
 
time.
