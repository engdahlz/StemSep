    -  ZFTurbo's  Demucs  v4  vocals  2023 (on  MVSEP,  unavailable  in  Colab,  good  when  everything  else  fails)  -  MDX23  Colab  fork  2.1 /  2.2 (this  might  be  slow)  /  2.3 /  2.4 /  2.5 (it's  generally  better  than  UVR  ensembles  SDR-wise,  but  it's  not  available  in  UVR5)  (MDX23  Colab  is  good  also  for  
instrumentals
 
and

 -  Narrowband  MDX23C_D1581  “Leaves  too  much  instrumental  bleeding  /  non-vocal  sounds

  -  Kavas'  methods  for  HQ  vocals:   Ensemble  (Max/Max)  -  Low  pass  filter  (brickwall)  at  2k:  -  MDX23C  -  Voc  FT  Voc  FT  -  High  Pass  Filter  (brickwall)  at  2k   (“Sometimes  it  leaves  some  synth  bleeding  in  the  mids"  then  try  out  min/min)   Or:  Multiband  EQ  split  at  2kHz  with  a  low  &  high  pass  brickwall  filter  with:   -MDX23C-InstVoc  from  0  to  2kHz  and:  -Voc_FT  from  2kHz  onwards   (InstVoc  gives  fuller  mids,  but  leaves  transients  from  hats  in  the  high  end,  whereas  Voc  ft  
lacks
 
the
 
mids,
 
but
 
gets
 
rid
 
of
 
most
 
transients.
 
Combine
 
the

both
 
for
 
optimal
 
results.)
  -  Any  top ensemble  or  AI  appearing  on  MVSEP  leaderboard  (but  it  depends,  -  sometimes  it  can  be  better  for  instrumental,  sometimes  vocals  Ensembles  are  resource  consuming,  no  cutoff  if  one  model  is  fullband  and  the  other  is  
narrowband.
 
Random
 
ensembles
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
more
 
vocal
 
or
 
instrumental
 
residues,
 
as
 
mentioned
 
above.
  Models  not  exclusive  for  MVSEP  are  all  available  in  UVR5  GUI,  or  optionally  you  can  separate  MDX  models  in  Colab and  perform  manual  ensemble  in  UVR5  (no  GPU  or  fast  CPU  required  for  this  task)  or  use  manual  ensemble  in  Colab [may  not  work  anymore])  or  also  in  DAW  by  importing  all  the  stems  together  and  decreasing  volume  (you  might  want  to  
turn
 
on
 
limiter
 
on
 
the
 
sum).
