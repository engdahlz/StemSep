[page 421/642]
    In  some  very  specific  cases  you  can  get  a  bit  better  results  for  some  songs  by  converting  
your
 
input
 
FLAC/WAV
 
16
 
to
 
WAV
 
32
 
in
 
e.g.
 
Foobar2000.
  Troubleshooting   -  (fixed  for  me)  Sometimes  very  long  " Waiting "  or  recently  “Waiting”  -  can  disappear  after  
refreshing
 
the
 
site
 
after
 
some
 
time
 
(July
 
2023)
 
-
 
e.g.
 
if
 
you
 
see
 
“SSG
 
complete”
 
message,
 
you
 
can
 
refresh
 
the
 
site
 
to
 
change
 
from
 
waiting
 
to
 
waveform
 
view
 
immediately.
 
I
 
had
 
that
 
on
 
a
 
fresh
 
account
 
once
 
when
 
uploading
 
the
 
very
 
first
 
file
 
on
 
that
 
account,
 
and
 
then
 
it
 
stopped
 
happening
 
(later
 
it
 
happened
 
for
 
me
 
on
 
an
 
old
 
account
 
as
 
well).
  -  (might  be  fixed  too)  If  you  don’t  see  all  stems  after  separation  (e.g.  while  choosing  2  
stems,
 
only
 
vocals
 
or
 
only
 
instrumental
 
is
 
shown)
 
and
 
only
 
one
 
stem
 
can
 
be
 
downloaded
 
(can’t
 
be
 
done
 
on
 
mobile
 
browser)
 
-
 
workaround:
  -  "Aw  snap"  error  on  mobile  Chrome  can  happen  on  regular  FLACs  as  well  as  an  attempt  to  
download
 
a
 
song.
 
Simply
 
go
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
main
 
page
 
and
 
try
 
to
 
load
 
the
 
song
 
again
 
and
 
download
 
it.
  -  If  nothing  happens  when  you  press  download  button  on  PC,  also  go  to  Chrome  
DevTools>Network>All
 
and
 
click
 
download
 
again.
 
Then
 
new
 
files
 
will
 
appear
 
on
 
the
 
list.
 
Right
 
click
 
and
 
open
 
mp3
 
file
 
in
 
a
 
new
 
tab
 
to
 
begin
 
download.
 
Alternatively,
 
log
 
into
 
your
 
account
 
in
 
incognito
 
mode.
  -  If  you  have  "An  error  has  occurred.  Please  reload  the  page  and  try  again."  try  deleting  
Chrome
 
on
 
mobile
 
(cleaning
 
cache
 
wasn't
 
enough
 
in
 
one
 
case).
  -  (rather  fixed)  If  you  have  “ no  audio ”  error  all  the  time  when  separation  is  done,  or  preview  
loading
 
is
 
infinite,
 
or
 
you
 
have
 
only
 
one
 
stem,
 
also
 
-
 In  PC  Chrome  go  to  DevTools>Network>All and  refresh  this  audio  preview  site,  and  new  entries  will  show  up  on  the  right,  which  among  others  will  list  filenames  with  your  input  file  
name
 
with
 
stems
 
names
 
e.g.
 
"rest
 
of
 
targets"
 
in
 
the
 
end.
 Double  click  it  or  click  RBM  on  it  and  press  open  on  new  tab,  and  download  will  start.  If  no  filenames  to  download  appear  on  the  list,  press  CTRL+R  to  refresh  the  site,  and  now  
they
 
should
 
appear.
 In  specific  cases,  files  in  the  list  won’t  show  up,  and  you  will  be  forced  to  log  in  to  GSEP  
using
 
incognito
 
mode
 
(the
 
same
 
account
 
and
 
result
 
can
 
be
 
used).
 
Also,
 
make
 
sure
 
you
 
have
 
enough
 
of
 
disk
 
space
 
on
 
C:.
 Alternatively,  clean  site/browser  cache  (but  the  latter  didn't  help  me  at  some  point  in  the  past,  
don't
 
know
 
how
 
now).
 If  still  the  same,  use  VPN  and/or  new  account  (all  three  at  the  same  time  only  in  very  specific  
cases
 
when
 
everything
 
fails).
 
You
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
different
 
browser.
