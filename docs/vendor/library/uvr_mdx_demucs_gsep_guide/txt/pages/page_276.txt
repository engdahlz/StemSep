    "UVR-MDX  still  struggles  with  acoustic  songs  (with  a  lot  of  pianos,  guitars,  soft  drums  etc.)"  
so
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
use
 
e.g.
 
GSEP
 
instead.
  Description  of  vocal  models  by  Erosunica   "That's  my  list  of  useful  MDX-NET  models  (vocal  primary),  best  to  worst:   -  MDX23C-8KFFT-InstVoc_HQ  (Attenuates  some  non-verbal  vocalizations:  short  low-level  
and/or
 
high-frequency
 
sounds)
 -  Kim  Vocal  2  -  UVR-MDX-NET-Voc_FT  -  Kim  Vocal  1  -  Main  (Attenuates  some  low  level  non-verbal  vocalizations)  -  Main_340  (Attenuates  some  non-verbal  vocalizations)  -  Main_406  (Attenuates  some  non-verbal  vocalizations)  -  Kim  Inst  (Attenuates  some  non-verbal  vocalizations)  -  Inst_HQ_3  (Attenuates  some  non-verbal  vocalizations)  -  MDXNET_2_9682  (Attenuates  some  non-verbal  vocalizations)"  and  it’s  also  worth  to  check  HQ_4.   
“UVR  BVE  v2  model  [currently  on  x-minus]  is  actually  full  band.  There  is,  however,  a  small  
nuance.
 
This
 
model
 
uses
 
MDX
 
VocFT
 
preprocessing,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
full
 
band.
 
MDX
 
VocFT
 
model
 
is
 
rebalancing
 
the
 
song.
 
The
 
music
 
is
 
slightly
 
mixed
 
with
 
the
 
vocals
 
(25%
 
music
 
+
 
100%
 
vocals).
 
This
 
mix
 
is
 
then
 
processed
 
by
 
the
 
BVE
 
model.
 
A
 
small
 
amount
 
of
 
music
 
can
 
help
 
the
 
model
 
better
 
understand
 
the
 
context
 
(it's
 
important
 
for
 
harmony
 
separation).
 
We
 
train
 
the
 
model
 
on
 
a
 
rebalanced
 
dataset.
 
It
 
contains
 
25%
 
of
 
music.”

 In  one  of  the  pre-5.6  UVR  updates,  the  following  min/avg/max  features  for  single  models  got  
replaced
 
by
 
a
 
better

e.g.
 voc_ft  with  max_mag  on  X-Minus  or  in  this Colab  still  utilizing  it  (or  downgrade  your  UVR  version).
