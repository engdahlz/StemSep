    separated  instrumental.  It  handles  trap  really  well  and  preserves  hi-hats  correctly,  but  in  cost  
of
 
other
 
stem
 
bleeding.
 
v4
 
model
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
clean
 
it
 
a
 
bit
 
further,
 -  htdemucs  v4  non-ft  (UVR  default)  -  it  can  clean  up  other  stem  bleeding  of  the  above  -  htdemucs_mmi  -  probably  faster,  but  worse  quality,  v3  -  kuielab_b  -  lighting-fast,  but  quality  is  mediocre  (but  rather  still  better  than  Spleeter)   ___   Older  vocal  models  (legacy  section)   -  Mel-Roformer  unwa’s  inst-voc  model  called  “duality  v1/2”  (focused  on  both  instrumental  
and
 
vocal
 
stem
 
during
 
training,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
now
 
test
 
newer
 
V1e+
 
single
 
stem
 
for
 
this
 
purpose
 
too).
 
 https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-InstVoc-Duality |  Colab |  MVSEP Vocals  sound  similar  to  beta  4  model,  but  with  more  noise,   
instrumentals
 
are
 
deprived
 
of
 
the
 
noise
 
present
 
in
 
inst
 
v1
 
and
 
later
 
inst
 
models,
 
but
 
as
 
a
 
downside,
 
they’re
 
more
 
muddy
 
for
 
instrumentals.
 
v2
 
have
 
slightly
 
a
 
bit
 
better
 
SDR
 
and
 
fewer
 
residues
  Because  duality  is  a  two  stems  target  model.  "other"  is  output  from  model  "Instrumental"  is  inverted  vocals  against  input  audio.  The  latter  has  lower  SDR  and  more  holes  in  the  spectrum.  So,  using  MSST-GUI,  leave  the  checkbox  “extract  instrumental”  disabled  for  duality  models.  You  can  use  it  in  the  Bas  Curtiz’  GUI for  ZFTurbo  script  (already  added)  or  with  the  OG  ZF’s  repo,  or  in  the  Colab.   -  Aname  duality  Mel  model  -  Aname  Full  Scratch  Mel-Band  Roformer  model bleedless  30.75  fullness  13.24,  SDR:  8.01   -  SYHFT  (a.k.a.  SYH99999/yukunelatyh)  MelBandRoformer  V3  |  model VS  previous  SYH’s  models  “this  version  is  more  consistent  with  separation.  It's  not  what  I'd  
call
 
a
 
clean
 
model;
 
It
 
sometimes
 
lets
 
background
 
noise
 
bleed
 
into
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem.
 
But
 
only
 
somewhat,
 
and
 
depending
 
on
 
how
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
it,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
thing
 
since
 
it
 
makes
 
the
 
vocals
 
sound
 
less
 
muddy.”

  -  MelBandRoformerBigSYHFTV1Fast  |  model -  more  vocal  fullness  metric,  but  more  bleeding  (although  less  than  duality  models  and  even  Kim’s  purely  metric-wise).  “same  parameters  size  with  Kim's.  Other  models  are  2x  scale  parameter  size  to  compare  my  
model”
