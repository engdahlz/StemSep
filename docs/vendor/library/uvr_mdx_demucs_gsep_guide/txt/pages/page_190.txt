    0n)  Ripple (no  longer  works)  /  Capcut.cn  (uses  SAMI-ByteDance  a.k.a.  BS-Roformer  arch)  -  Ripple  is  for  iOS  14.1  and  US  region  set  only  -  despite  high  SDR,  it's  better  for  vocals  than  instrumentals  which  
are
 
not
 
so
 
good
 
due
 
to
 
noise
 
in
 
other
 
stem
 
(can
 
be
 
alleviated
 
by
 
decreasing
 
volume
 
by
 
-3dB).
 
 0n)  Capcut  (for  Windows)  allows  separation  only  for  the  Chinese  version  above  (and  returns  stems  in  worse  quality).  See  more for  a  workaround.  Sadly,  it  normalizes  input  already,  so  -3dB  trick  won’t  work  in  Capcut.  Also,  it  has  worse  quality  than  Ripple    The  best  single  MDX-UVR  non-Roformer  models  for  instrumentals  explained  in  more  detail   (UVR  5  GUI/Colabs/MVSEP/x-minus):   0.  full  band  MDX-Net  HQ_4  -  faster,  and  an  improvement  over  HQ_3  (it  was  trained  for  
epoch
 
1149).
 
In
 
rare
 
cases
 
there’s
 
more
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
vs
 
HQ_3
 
(sometimes
 
“at
 
points
 
where
 
only
 
the
 
vocal
 
part
 
starts
 
without
 
music
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
hear
 
vocal
 
residue,
 
when
 
the
 
music
 
starts
 
then
 
the
 
voice
 
disappears
 
altogether”).
 
Also,
 
it
 
can
 
leave
 
some
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
fadeouts.
 
More
 
often
 
instrumental
 
bleeding
 
in
 
vocals,
 
but
 
the
 
model
 
is
 
made
 
mainly
 
for
 
instrumentals
 
(like
 
HQ_3
 
in
 
general)
  0b)  full  band  MDX-Net  HQ_5  -  similarly  fast,  might  be  less  noisy,  but  more  muddy,  although  
better
 
for
 
vocals,
 
but
 
“it
 
seems
 
it's
 
the
 
best
 
workaround
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
caused
 
by
 
Roformers”
  1.  full  band  MDX-Net  HQ_3  -  like  above,  might  be  sometimes  simply  the  best,  pretty  
aggressive
 
as
 
for
 
instrumental
 
model,
 
but
 
still
 
leaving
 
small
 
amounts
 
of
 
vocal
 
residues
 
at
 
times
 
-
 
but
 
not
 
like
 
BS-Roformer
 
v2/viperx,
 
so
 
results
 
are
 
not
 
so
 
filtered
 
like
 
in
 
these.
 
 HQ_3  filters  out  flute  into  vocals.  Can  be  still  useful  to  this  day  for  specific  use  cases  “the  
only
 
model
 
that
 
kept
 
some
 
gated
 
FX
 
vocals
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
keep”.
 It  all  depends  on  a  song,  what’s  the  best  -  e.g.  the  one  below  might  give  better  clarity:   2.  full  band  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ  (since  UVR  5.60;  22kHz/fullband  as  well)  -  tends  to  have  
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
instrumentals,
 
but
 
can
 
give
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
for
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
songs.
 Added  also  in  MDX23  2.2.2 Colab,  possibly  when  weights  include  only  that  model,  but  UVR's  implementation  might  be  more  correct  for  only  that  single  model.  Available  also  in  KaraFan so  it  can  be  used  there  only  as  a  solo  model.   2b.  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ  2  -  worse  SDR,  sometimes  less  vocal  residues   Older  MDX  models   2c.  narrowband  MDX23C_D1581  (model_2_stem_061321,  14.7kHz)  -  better  SDR  vs  HQ_3  and  voc_ft  (single  model  file  download [just  for  archiving  purposes])   "really  good,  but  (...)  it  filters  some  string  and  electric  guitar  sounds  into  the  vocals  output"  
also
 
has
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
vs
 
HQ_3.
