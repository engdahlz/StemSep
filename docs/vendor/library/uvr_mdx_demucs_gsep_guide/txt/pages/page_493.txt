    10)  Go  to  allflac.com -  it’s  paid,  but  they  don’t  pay  royalties  to  the  artist  and  its  labels,  as  I  spoke  with  at  least  one.  They  don’t  keep  up  with  the  content  with  the  streaming  services,  but  
they
 
share
 
stuff
 
also
 
not
 
available
 
on
 
streaming
 
services,
 
even
 
including
 
vinyl
 
rips
 
as
 
hi-res
 
ones.
 
Most
 
if
 
not
 
all
 
the
 
files
 
on
 
the
 
site
 
are
 
CD
 
rips
 
taken
 
from
 
around
 
the
 
net.
  I’ll  explain  to  you  how  to  download  files  for  free  from  allflac  and  flacit:   0.  Log  in  1.  Find  desired  album  (don't  press  play  yet!)  2.  Open  the  Chrome  Menu  in  the  upper-right-hand  corner  of  the  browser  window  and  select  
More
 
Tools
 
>
 
Developer
 
Tools>navigate
 
to
 
“Network”
 3.  Press  CTRL+R  as  prompted  4.  Play  audio  file  5.  If  it's  16/44  FLAC,  go  to  media,  sort  by  size,  right-click  on  the  entry  and  open  in  new  tab  to  
download
 
(sometimes
 
it
 
appear
 
after
 
some
 
time
 
of
 
playing
 
and
 
only
 
in
 
“all”
 
instead
 
of
 
“media”)
 6*.  On  some  24  bit  files,  go  to  all,  play  the  file  and  sort  by  size.  You  will  find  an  entry  with  
increasing
 
size
 
with
 
xhr
 
type
 
and
 
flac
 
name
 
if
 
it’s
 
not
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
media
 
tab.
 7.  Recently  it  happened  once,  that  the  point  five  stopped  working  and  the  FLAC  link  is  red.  
Now
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
console
 
and
 
open
 
a
 
link
 
with
 
ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
tab
 
and
 
open
 
the
 
site,
 
clicking
 
on
 
advanced.
  In  case  of  a  32  KB/s  download,  get  Free  Download  Manager,  and  paste  the  download  link  
there,
 
and
 
with
 
2
 
active
 
connections
 
in
 
the
 
downloader,
 
it
 
will
 
speed
 
up
 
to
 
96KB/s
 
occasionally
 
(properly
 
set
 
JDownloader
 
also
 
allows
 
increasing
 
number
 
of
 
connections).
 
Haven’t
 
tried
 
switching
 
accounts
 
to
 
check
 
if
 
it
 
will
 
make
 
the
 
speeds
 
back
 
to
 
normal
 
(it
 
wasn’t
 
like
 
that
 
before).
  Some  albums  on  allflac.com  don't  have  tracks  separated,  but  all  the  albums  are  in  track  1.   If  you  want  to  physically  divide  the  audio  file  -  In  such  case,  you  can  search  for  cue  sheet  here:  https://www.regeert.nl/cuesheet/ Place  it  near  the  file,  and  eventually  rename,  and  it's  ready,  but  it's  only  for  playing  and  
playlist
 
purposes.
 
It
 
doesn't
 
separate
 
the
 
audio
 
file
 
physically.
 
To
 
cut
 
the
 
file
 
losslessly
 
you
 need  lossless-cut  https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/ -  it  allows  importing  cue  sheets  to  cut  the  album.  Now  if  you  have  all  the  files  divided  you  can  probably  use  
MusicBrainz
 
(probably
 
Foobar2000
 
plugin
 
is
 
available)
 
to
 
tag
 
the
 
files
 
(but
 
not
 
the
 
filenames
 
-
 
for
 
that,
 
you
 
need
 
mp3tag
 
and
 
tagged
 
files
 
to
 
copy
 
tags
 
to
 
filenames
 
with
 
specific
 
masks).
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
lossless-cut
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
precise,
 
and
 
it
 
may
 
create
 
a
 
problem
 
with
 
automatic
 
content
 
detection
 
in
 
MusicBrainz,
 
but
 
I
 
know
 
that
 
tool
 
or
 
similar
 
allowed
 
to
 
just
 
search
 
for
 
the
 
album
 
you
 
specifically
 
searched
 
for,
 
and
 
not
 
by
 
just
 
mark
 
files>album
 
detection
 
in
 
Foobar
 
which
 
may
 
fail.
 
So
 
technically
 
cutting
 
and
 
tagging
 
the
 
files
 
should
 
be
 
possible,
 
but
 
time-consuming.
