     -  Mel-Roformer  viperx  1143  model  (UVR>Download  More  Models)  (don't  confuse  with  1053  which  separates  drums  and  bass  in  one  stem).  The  first  Mel-Roformer  vocal  model  trained  by  viperx  before  Kim  model  which  introduced  
changes
 
to
 
the
 
config,
 
which
 
fixed
 
the
 
problem
 
of
 
lower
 
SDR
 
vs
 
models
 
trained
 
on
 
BS-Roformer.
 
 Most  people  back  then  preferred  Kim  Mel-Roformer  instead,  but  Mel  viperx’  “does  
background
 
voices
 
correctly
 
not
 
unlike
 
Kim's
 
(it
 
does
 
not
 
recognise
 
background
 
'breee's)”
 
“Iirc
 
Viperx
 
Mel
 
Rofo
 
doesn't
 
struggle
 
with
 
instruments
 
counted
 
as
 
vocals”.
 Also,  both  Mel  and  BS  variants  of  viperx  model  struggle  with  saxophone  and  e.g.  some  
Arabic
 
guitars.
 
It
 
can
 
still
 
depend
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
whether
 
these
 
are
 
better
 
than
 
even
 
the
 
second
 
oldest
 
Roformer
 
than
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
(from
 
before
 
viperx
 
model
 
got
 
fine-tuned
 
version).
 
Beside
 
problems
 
with
 
recognizing
 
instruments,
 
they're
 
very
 
good
 
for
 
vocals
 
(although
 
Mel-Roformer
 
by
 
Kim
 
on
 
x-minus
 
tends
 
to
 
be
 
better).
 Muddy  instrumentals  when  not  ensembled  with  other  archs  (but  we  didn’t  have  typically  
instrumental
 
stem
 
target
 
models
 
back
 
then),
 
maybe
 
Mel
 
variant
 
less.
 Be  aware  that  names  of  these  models  on  UVR  refer  to  SDR  measurements  of  vocals  
conducted
 
on
 
private
 
viperx
 
dataset,
 
not
 
even
 
older
 
Synthetic
 
dataset,
 
instead
 
of
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
hence
 
the
 
numbers
 
are
 
higher
 
than
 
in
 
the
 
multisong
 
chart
 
on
 
MVSEP.
    Depending  on  a  model,  Roformers  might  be  muddy .  Consider  using  ensembles  or  Apollo  enhancer  model  by  Lew  v2  (Colab/Model/Inference),  although  it  might  be  noisy.  Might  work  the  best  on  BS+Mel  ensembles  (max  spec,  though  avg  might  work  better  in  some  cases).    Older  ensembles  for  vocals   -  Models  ensembled  option  on  x-minus.pro  (available  only  for  premium  users)  >  Mel-Roformer  +  MDX23C  (can  be  picked  after  you  uploaded/processed  a  track  [at  least  
with
 
Mel-Roformer
 
model
 
chosen]).
  >  Mel-Roformer  +  demudder  “I  recommend  mel-roformer  +  demudder  to  remove  vocals  from  songs  that  contain  only  
backing
 
vocals
 
that
 
are
 
so
 
faint
 
that
 
our
 
ears
 
can
 
barely
 
hear
 
them.”
