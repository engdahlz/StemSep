     Ducking  effect  eliminator  You  can  also  check  Aufr33  Reaper  7.05  project  aimed  at  alleviating  this  issue:  “the  music  volume  is  reduced  where  there  are  vocals”.  Instruction:  
“Just
 
place
 
two
 
stems:
 
vocals
 
and
 
music.
 
Adjust
 
the
 
Expander
 
if
 
necessary.”
 “It's  just  an  expander  side-chained  to  vocals.  You  can  replicate  this  in  any  other  DAW.”  Src |  mirror  -  Nice  chart (>moved  to  “Advanced  chain  processing  chart”  at  the  bottom  of  Karaoke  section  (use  search)  describing  process  for  creating  AI  cover  (replace  kim  vocal  with  voc  ft  there,  or  MDX23

  “ My  use  Case :   Restoring  older,  lower-quality  vocal  recordings  (e.g.,  camcorder  recordings  from  the  90s)  
using
 
RVC
 
models
 
trained
 
on
 
clean
 
studio
 
vocals
 
from
 
the
 
same
 
artist.
  Practical  Workflow  for  Using  RVC  in  Vocal  Restoration   The  idea  is  not  to  replace  old  performances  entirely,  but  to  enhance  them.  A  few  key  points  
came
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
discussion:
  -  Blending,  not  replacing:  Using  only  the  RVC  output  will  usually  sound  artificial.  The  better  
approach
 
is
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
old
 
vocal
 
stems
 
through
 
the
 
trained
 
RVC
 
model
 
and
 
then
 
blend
 
the
 
AI-generated
 
stem
 
with
 
the
 
original.
 
This
 
preserves
 
natural
 
performance
 
qualities
 
while
 
adding
 
clarity.
  -  Input  quality  matters:  Even  “decent  but  rough”  camcorder  audio  can  work.  Extremely  
degraded
 
sources,
 
however,
 
will
 
still
 
produce
 
artifacts
 
(“bad
 
input
 
=
 
bad
 
output”).
  Complementary  tools:   FlashSR  –  an  audio  super-resolution  method  that  restores  high  frequencies  and  improves  fidelity  before  running  RVC.  (https://mvsep.com/en/demo?algorithm_id=60)  [AudioSR  might  potentially  giver  better  results,  but  it’s  much  slower;  “Imo  much  better  candidates  are:  AP-BWE (Colab |  new  repo [old])  and  Clearer-Voice-Studio's  Clear  Voice (my  favorite  is  the  2nd  one  -  codename0;  more  simplified  version  by  codename0  -  DL”]  Matchering  –  matches  EQ/tonal  balance  of  rough  recordings  to  studio  references,  either  
standalone
 
or
 
integrated
 
into
 
UVR5.
 
Using
 
a
 
clean
 
studio
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
artist
 
as
 
the
 
reference
 
and
 
the
 
old
 
performance
 
as
 
the
 
target
 
is
 
recommended.
