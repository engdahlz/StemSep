    (src)   Lower  fullness  models   (if  you  find  the  ones  above  too  muddy,  but  here  you  get  more  noise)   0)  Gabox  inst_gabox3 (yaml)  |  Colab |  Huggingface /  2 |  Phase  fixer  Colab Inst.  fullness  37.69,  bleedless  35.93,  SDR  16.50  
Actually
 
worse
 
fullness
 
than
 
v1e+
 
(37.89),
 
and
 
lower
 
bleedless
 
(36.53).
 When  used  with  Unwa’s  beta  6  as  reference  for  phase  fixer  (thx  John  UVR),  slightly  less  
muddy
 
results
 
than
 
phase-fixed
 
Becruily
 
inst-voc
 
results,
 
but
 
also
 
slightly
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
and
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
inconsistent
 
sound,
 
fluctuations
 
across
 
the
 
whole
 
separation
 
at
 
times.
 
  0)  Gabox  INSTV7N |  Huggingface /  2 Inst.  fullness  36.83,  bleedless  35.47,  SDR:  16.65  More  noisy  than  INSTV7;  “it's  [even]  closer  to  v7  than  inst3”  __   0)  SCNet  XL  model  called  “very  high  fullness”  |  MVSEP Inst.  fullness  34.04,  bleedless  35.15,  SDR  16.60  It  might  work  better  than  Roformers  for  less  noisy/loud/busy  mixes  or  genres  like  alt-pop,  
orchestral
 
tracks
 
with
 
choir,
 
sometimes
 
giving
 
more
 
full
 
results
 
than
 
even
 
v1e,
 
but
 
at
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
more
 
noise.
 
Might
 
struggle
 
with
 
some
 
vocal
 
reverbs
 
or
 
effects.
 
“Very
 
hit

miss.
 
When
 
they're
 
good
 
they're
 
really
 
good

when
 
they're
 
bad
 
there's
 
nothing
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
other
 
than
 
use
 
a
 
different
 
model”
 
Compared
 
to
 
the
 
high

more
 
crossbleeding
 
of
 
vocals
 
in
 
instrumentals
 
(along
 
with
 
SCNet

basic
 
model).
 
Some
 
songs
 
which
 
sound
 
full
 
enough
 
even
 
with
 
basic
 
SCNet
 
XL
 
(and
 
HF
 
variant)
 
while
 
others
 
will
 
sound
 
muddy
 
(dca)
 “has  a  lot  of  noise/bleed,  and  I  haven't  found  the  best  way  to  get  rid  of  it,  but  it  does  tend  to  
pick
 
up
 
harmonies
 
and
 
subtle
 
BGV
 
that
 
other
 
models
 
don't.”

“Really
 
loving
 
the
 
way
 
SCnet
 
high
 
fullness
 
[variant]
 
handles
 
lower
 
frequencies,
 
below
 
2K
 
[let’s]
 
say.
 
Roformers
 
are
 
better
 
with
 
the
 
transients
 
up
 
high,
 
but
 
decay
 
on
 
guitars/keys
 
on
 
the
 
SCnet
 
is
 
more
 
natural”
 “seems  to  also  confuse  less  "difficult"  instruments  for  vocals”  “I  noticed  classic  SCNet  XL  preserves  more  instruments  than  the  high  fullness  one,  but  has  
more
 
vocal
 
crossbleeding
 
in
 
instrumental
 
compared
 
to
 
high
 
fullness
 So  if  you  want  instrument  preservation  use  SCNet  XL  1727  but  if  you  want  less  
crossbleeding
 
of
 
vocals
 
in
 
instrumental
 
use
 
SCNet
 
XL
 
high
 
fullness
 I  ignore  the  very  high  fullness  one  because  it  has  too  much  vocal  residue”  dca
