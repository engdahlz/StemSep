Revoice  Pro  5   Bleeding  of  instruments  in  vocals  -  Denoise  model  with  0.1-0.2  aggressiveness   Cleaning  the  white  noise/sizzle  inside  the  vocals  (from  e.g.  Roformer  models)  -  MDX23C  model  (e.g.  the  latest  on  MVSEP  or  HQ  in  UVR)  _______   Debleeding  guide  by  Bas  Curtis (other  methods,  e.g.  Audacity)   Denoising and  dereverberation/apps later  below.   See  also  “Vinyl  noise/white  noise”  from  the  end  of  the  list.   _______   How  to  check  whether  a  model  in  UVR5  GUI  is  vocal  or  instrumental?   -  Read  carefully  the  models  list  above  -  they're  categorized  -  If  you  want  to  experiment  with  other  models:  The  moment  you  see  "Instrumental"  on  top  (and  "Vocal"  below)  in  the  list  where  GPU  
conversion
 
is
 
mentioned,
 
you
 
know
 
it's
 
an
 
instrumental
 
model.
 When  it  flips  the  sequence,  so  Vocal  on  top,  you  know  it's  a  vocal  model.   Same  happens  for  MDX  and  VR  archs.  -  “Be  aware  that  MDX23C/MDXv3  models  can  be  multisource  -  it  depends  on  the  
training,
 
so
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
only
 
vocals,
 
or
 
only
 
instrumental,
 
or
 
vocals+instrumental,
 
or
 
vocals+drums+bass+other
 
(like
 
baseline
 
models
 
are),
 
or
 
whatever
 
else.
 -  You  can  know  it  looking  at  the  config  file  of  the  model,  for  example  InstVocHQ,   https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/blob/master/models/MDX_Net_Models/model_data/mdx_c_configs/model_2_stem_full_band_8k.yaml Seeing  by  the  instruments  line  above,  D1581  and  InstVocHQ  models  are  
instrumental+vocal.
 Config  for  the  rest  of  the  models:  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/blob/master/models/MDX_Net_Models/model_data/model_data.json  (decoded  hashes)  ____________________________________________________________________
