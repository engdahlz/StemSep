    -  IntroC  created  a  script for  mitmproxy  for  Capcut  allowing  fullband  output,  by  slowing  down  the  track.  Video  -  Jazzpear  created  new  VR  SFX  model.  Sometimes  it’s  better,  sometimes  it’s  worse  than  Forte’s model.  Download For  UVR  5.x  GUI,  use  these  parameters  (irc  same  as  Forte):   User  input  stem  name:  SFX  Do  NOT  check  inverse  stem!  1band  sr44100  hl  1024   -  Now  KaraFan  should  work  locally  on  4GB  GTX  GPUs  (e.g.  laptop  1060),  on  presets  2  or  3,  
and
 
with

  -Bas  Curtiz'  new  video  on  how  to  install  and  use  Capcut  for  separation  incl.  exporting:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppfyl91bJIw and  saving  directly  as  FLAC,  although  the  core  source  of  FLAC  is  still  AAC  in  this  case:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEQFzj6-5pk  "It's  a  bit  of  a  hassle  to  set  it  up,  but  do  realize:  -  This  is  the  only  way  (besides  Ripple  on  iOS)  to  run  ByteDance's  model  (best  based  on  
SDR).
 -  Only  the  Chinese  version  has  these  VIP  features;  now  u  will  have  it  in  English  -  Exporting  is  a  paid  feature  (normally);  now  u  get  it  for  free   The  instructions  displayed  in  the  video  are  also  in  the  YouTube  description."   Capcut  normalizes  the  input,  so  you  cannot  use  Bas’  trick  to  decrease  volume  by  -3dB  like  in  
Ripple
 
to
 
workaround
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
bleeding
 
(unless
 
you
 
trick
 
out
 
the
 
CapCut,
 
possibly
 
by
 
adding
 
some
 
loud
 
sound
 
in
 
the
 
song
 
with
 
decreased
 
volume,
 
something
 
like
 
presented
 here).   -  (fixed)  KaraFan  Colab  will  be  fixed  on  27th  at  morning.   -  There’s  a  workaround  for  people  not  able  to  split  using  Capcut.  The  app  discriminate  based  
on
 
country
 
(poor/rich)
 
and
 
paywalls

option.
  
 The  video demonstration  for  below  0.  Go  offline.  1.  Install  the  Chinese  version  from  capcut.cn 2.  Use  these  files  copied  over  your  current  Chinese  installation,  and  don’t  use  English  patch.   3.  Open  CapCut,  go  online  after  closing  welcome  screen,  happy  converting!  4.  Before  you  close  the  app,  go  offline  again  (or  the  separation  option  will  be  gone  later).
