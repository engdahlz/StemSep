    Bleedness and  fullness
 
leaderboard
  Python  evaluation  script by  jarredou  (prob.  mirror),  Torch  version (with  Bas  Curtiz),  used  on  Quality  Checker Librosa  version  added  to  ZFTurbo  training  repo.   More  detailed  and  reliable  method  of  evaluation  on  multisong  dataset  than  SDR.

 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pPEJpu4tZjTkjPh_F5YjtIyHq8v0SxLnBydfUBUNlbI/edit?usp=sharing (shortened  version -  it’s  outdated  -  all  metrics  are  rewritten  in  the  models  sections  above)  For  some  newer  models  not  on  the  list,  you  could  search  here for  the  model  name,  and  bleedless/fullness  metrics  for  new  models  are  now  provided  in  the  evaluation  description  
when
 
you
 
click
 
on
 
the
 
result,
 
but
 
plenty
 
of
 
model
 
evaluations
 
have
 
names
 
not
 
corresponding
 
to
 
final
 
model
 
names
 
and
 
were
 
shared
 
along
 
with
 
models
 
on
 
our
 
Discord
 
and
 
later
 
pasted
 
to
 
this
 
document
 
above.
 
Also,
 
sorting
 
by
 
specific
 
metric
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
was
 
added
 
in
 
June
 
2025,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
track
 
the
 
exact
 
evaluation
 
by
 
provided
 
metrics
 
in
 
this
 
document
 
that
 
way,
 
or
 
by
 
searching
 
Discord,
 
but
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
difficult,
 
as
 
links
 
to
 
some
 
older
 
models’
 
evaluations
 
were
 
not
 
indexed
 
by
 
the
 
metrics
 
bot,
 
so
 
once
 
the
 
evaluation
 
was
 
posted,
 
the
 
bot
 
wasn’t
 
showing
 
metrics
 
from
 
the
 
beginning,
 
and
 
not
 
all
 
models
 
were
 
evaluated
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
model
 
release.
  Explanations  on  the  metric  Spectrogram  difference  showcase  diagram “Blue  is  what  is  missing  from  separated  stem  (compared  to  clean  source).  Red  is  bleed  in  separated  stem.  White  is  perfect  (dB  scale  on  right  seems  wrong,  I  haven't  checked,  but  it's  not  really  important  to  see  what  is  
going
 
on).
 
 Same  formula  [can]  be  used  for  a  metric,  which  would  theoretically  measure  bleedness  and  
fullness
 
of
 
the
 
evaluated
 
models
 I  think  that  for  a  metric,  it's  better  to  then  separate  negative  values  of  diff  array  on  one  side,  
and
 
keep
 
positive
 
values
 
on
 
other
 
side,
 
and
 
average/scale
 
each
 
of
 
them
 
separately,
 
so
 
we
 
get
 
2
 
scores,
 
1
 
for
 
bleedness
 
and
 
1
 
for
 
fullness.
 It  has  to  be  experimented  further  (and  with  better  stft,  it's  only  working  on  single  chunk  
currently)
 (Not  sure  that  so  high  n_fft/mel_bins  values  are  really  needed,  it  was  just  nicer  on  the  plot  
with
 
that)”
  “bleedless/fullness  metrics  are  stft  magnitude-only  based  and  as  they  are  discarding  the  
phase
 
data,
 
they
 
have
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
blind
 
spots.”
