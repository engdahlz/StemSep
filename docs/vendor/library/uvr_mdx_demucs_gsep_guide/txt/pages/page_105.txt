    Linux   
Old
 
patch
 
#9
 
only
 
for
 
now
 
(no
 
demudder,
 
some
 
fixable
 
issues
 
with
 
certain
 
models):
  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/tree/v5.6.0_roformer_add%2Bdirectml  (for  older  patches  and  more  infoand  troubleshooting  refer  here)    -  Some  newer  Mel/BS  models  really  require  the  newest  Roformer  patches  (otherwise  you’ll  
get
 
MLP
 
error).
  
 -  In  the  Download  Center  you’ll  find  some  BS/Mel  models,  but  not  all.  Refer  to  the  full  list  of  models  here.     Installing  custom  Roformer  models  in  UVR  
(those
 
unavailable
 
in
 
Download
 
More
 
Models
 
a.k.a.
 
Download
 
Center)
  -  Since  patch  #10  new  “Install  Model”  option  was  added.  
Click
 
RBM
 
on
 
the
 
models’
 
list
 
to
 
access
 
the
 
option
 
and
 
follow
 
the
 
instructions
 
on
 
your
 
screen.
 
  -  Models  for  Mel/BS  Roformer,  SCNet  and  Bandit  Plus/v2  are  located  in  the  MDX-Net  menu.   -  For  most  models,  you  need  both  ckpt  and  yaml  file  for  the  model  to  work  (if  it’s  not  the  
same
 
with
 
any
 
config
 
you
 
already
 
downloaded
 
before
 
-
 
some
 
models
 
share
 
the
 
same
 
config
 
file
 
-
 
e.g.
 
one
 
folder
 
with
 
models
 
in
 
the
 
repository
 
might
 
have
 
only
 
one
 
yaml)
 If  you  opened  yaml  file  to  download,  but  its  content  opened  instead  of  its  downloading  
started,
 
press
 
CTRL+S
 
or
 
go
 
to
 
options
 
of
 
your
 
browser
 
and
 
find
 
the
 
option
 
called
 
“Save
 
As”.
 Now  you’ll  have  a  txt  extension,  but  we  need  it  to  be  yaml  (otherwise  UVR  won’t  detect  it),  so  
choose
 
All
 
files
 
in
 
Extension,
 
and
 
edit
 
it
 
there
 
manually
 
to
 
yaml
 
(or
 
after
 
download).
 
  -  If  you  don’t  see  ckpt  on  the  extensions  list,  perform  clean  UVR  installation  from  the  patches  
above
 
  -  In  “Set  Model  Type”,  most  Roformers  will  use  Roformer  non-v2  (and  most  are  Mel).   
For
 
now,
 
you
 
should
 
pick
 
v2
 
Roformer
 
type
 
probably
 
only
 
for
 
unwa
 
400MB
 
experimental
 
model
 
(if
 
you
 
have
 
lots
 
of
 
layers
 
errors
 
using
 
Roformers,
 
it
 
means
 
you
 
picked
 
v2
 
config
 
unnecessarily).
 
  -  Manual  model  installation  for  e.g.  Demucs  which  doesn’t  have  “Install  model”  option  (or  for  
patch
 
before
 
#10)
 
-
 
on
 
example
 
of
 
MDX/Roformers/SCNet/Bandit.
