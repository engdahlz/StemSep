    between  quality  and  time  for  6GB  graphic  cards:   _____   VR   Window  Size:  320  (best  measured  SDR)  Faster  value  for  slow  PCs:  512  Slower,  might  give  more  artefacts:  272   Worse:  768,  1024   Read  more  in  VR  settings  _____   Demucs   Segment:  Default  Shifts:  2  (def)  Overlap:  0.5   (experimental:  0.75,   default:  0.25)   The  best  SDR  for  the  least  time  for  Demucs  (more  a  compromise,  as  it  takes  much  longer  
than
 
default
 
settings
 
ofc
 
-
 
“best
 
SDR
 
is
 
a
 
hair
 
more
 
SDR
 
and
 
a
 
sh*load
 
of
 
more
 
time):
  Segments:  Default  Shifts:  0  Overlap:  0.99  (max  can  be  0.999  or  even  more,  but  it’s  getting  tremendously  long)    Best  results  for  instrumentals  as  input  (tested  in  Colab):  Segments:  Default  Shifts:  10  (20  is  max  possible)  Overlap:  0.1   "Overlap  can  reduce/remove  artifacts  at  audio  chunks/segments  boundaries,  and  improve  a  
little
 
bit
 
the
 
results
 
the
 
same
 
way
 
the
 
shift
 
trick
 
works
 
(merging
 
multiple
 
passes
 
with
 
slightly
 
different
 
results,
 
each
 
with
 
good
 
and
 
bad).
 But  it  can't  fix  the  model  flaws  or  change  its  characteristics"   In  case  of  Voc_FT  it's  more  nuanced...  there  it  seems  to  make  a  substantial  difference  
SDR-wise.
