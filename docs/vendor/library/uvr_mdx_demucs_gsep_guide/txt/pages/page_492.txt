    Alternatively  check:  
Qobuz
 
Downloader
 
X
 
 or  Allavsoft  (both  requires  subscription)   https://www.qobuz-dl.com/ (takendown  frontend  browser  client  for  downloading  music  for  Qobuz.  The  code  for  hosting  on  GH)   7b)  https://github.com/nathom/streamrip A  scriptable  stream  downloader  for  Qobuz,  Tidal,  Deezer  (active  subscription  required)  and  
SoundCloud.
  8*)  For  Deezer  you  can  use  Deezloader or  Deezloader  Remix  -  it  doesn’t  require  any  subscription  for  mp3  128kbps,  just  register  a  Deezer  account  for  free  before,  and  use  the  
account
 
in
 
the
 
app.
 
For
 
free
 
users
 
it
 
gives
 
only
 
mp3
 
128kbps
 
with
 
16kHz,
 
so
 
it's
 
worse
 
than
 
YT
 
and
 
Opus,
 
so
 
don't
 
bother.
  9a)  For  Spotify,  you  can  use  Soggfy,  or    9b)  SpotiDown  (premium  subscription  for  320kbps  downloading  and  app  compiling  required)   9c**  Seemingly  you  can  use  https://spotiflyer.app/ but  it  “doesn't  download  from  Spotify,  but  from  Saavn,  in  128kbps/low-quality.  Also,  since  it  doesn't  d/l  from  Spotify,  you  can't  d/l  exclusives  released  from  there.”   It  doesn't  require  a  valid  subscription  irc  and  also  allows  playing  and  sharing  music  inside  the  
app.
