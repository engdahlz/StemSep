    models  will  be  released  in  a  few  weeks  (and  as  it  was  usually  before,  on  x-minus  first  for  a  few  weeks  later).  Download (install  beta  patch first  and  drop  it  into  the  MDX-Net  models  folder).  The  patch  is  for  only  Windows  now,  with  an  upcoming  Mac  patch  planned  later.  For  
Linux,
 
there's
 
probably
 
a
 
source
 
of
 
the
 
patch
 
already
 
out.
  MDX23C_D1581  parameters  are  set  up  with  its  yaml  config  file  and  its  n_fft  value  is  12288,  
not
 
7680.
 
It
 
has
 
cutoff
 
at
 
14.7khz
 
(while
 
VOC-FT
 
cutoff
 
is
 
17.5khz)
  -  "(Probably  all)  models  are  stereo  and  can't  handle  mono  audio.  You  have  to  create  a  fake  
stereo
 
file
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
audio
 
content
 
on
 
the
 
L
 
and
 
R
 
channel
 
if
 
the
 
software
 
doesn't
 
make
 
it
 
by
 
itself."
 
Make
 
sure
 
that
 
the
 
other
 
channel
 
is
 
not
 
empty
 
when
 
isolation
 
is
 
executed
 
-
 
it
 
can
 
produce
 
silent
 
bleeding
 
of
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
opposite
 
channel
 
(happens
 
in
 
e.g.
 
MDX23
 
and
 
GSEP,
 
and
 
errors
 
with
 
mono
 
in
 
MDX-Net)
  -  ”For  Unbound  local”  error  while  you  do  anything  in  UVR  since  the  new  model  installation,  
you
 
might
 
be
 
forced
 
to
 
rollback
 
the
 
update
 
  -  Clear  the  Auto-Set  Cache  in  the  MDX-Net  menu  if  you  set  wrong  parameter  and  end  up  
with
 
error
  -  Pitch  shift  is  the  same  as  soprano  mode  except  in  the  GUI  beta  you  can  choose  how  many  
semitones
 
to
 
pitch
 
the
 
conversion
  -  Dango.ai  released  a  9.0  model.  We  received  a  very  positive  report  on  it  so  far.    -  UVR  beta  patch  released.  Potentially  new  SDR  increases  with  the  same  models.  Added  segmentation,  overlap  for  MDX  models,  batch  mode  changes.  Soprano  trick  added.  Basically,  you  can  set  it  by  semi-tones.   Support  for  MDX-NET23  arch.  For  now,  it  uses  only  basic  models  attached  by  Kuielab  (low  
SDR,
 
so
 
don't
 
bother
 
for
 
now),
 
but
 
UVR
 
team
 
already
 
trained
 
their
 
own
 
model
 
for
 
that
 
arch,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
released
 
later,
 
and
 
a
 
few
 
weeks
 
after
 
x-minus
 
and
 
MVSep.
 
And
 
it's
 
performing
 
well
 
already.
 
Wait™.
 
Don't
 
exceed
 
an
 
overlap
 
0.93-0.95
 
for
 
MDX
 
models,
 
it's
 
getting
 
tremendously
 
long
 
with
 
not
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
difference,
 
0.8
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
good
 
choice
 
as
 
well.
 
Also,
 
segments
 
can
 
ditch
 
the
 
performance
 
AF.
 
2560
 
might
 
be
 
still
 
a
 
high
 
but
 
balanced
 
value.
  
 Sadly,  it  looks  like  max  mag  for  single  models  is  no  longer  available  -  you  can  use  it  only  
under
 
Ensemble
 
Mode
 
for
 
now.
  Q:  What  is  Demucs  Pre-process  model?  A:  You  can  process  the  input  with  another  model  that  could  do  a  better  job  at  removing  
vocals
 
for
 
it
 
to
 
separate
 
into
 
the
 
other
 
3
 
stems
 Beta  UVR  patch  link  -  "Post-Process  [for  VR]  has  been  fixed,  the  very  end  bits  of  vocals  don't  bleed  anymore  no  
matter
 
which
 
threshold
 
value
 
is
 
used"
