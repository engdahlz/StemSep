    You  can  just  open  that  json,  and  edit  it  to  write  the  config  name  located  in  mdx_c_configs  
you
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
with
 
that
 
model.
 
You
 
should
 
find
 
proper
 
hashed
 
yaml
 
by
 
the
 
saved
 
model
 
of
 
your
 
choice,
 
but
 
if
 
you
 
really
 
feel
 
lost,
 
you
 
can
 
delete
 
all
 
hashed
 
yamls,
 
so
 
you’ll
 
need
 
to
 
go
 
through
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
choosing
 
configs
 
for
 
all
 
custom
 
MDX
 
and
 
Roformer
 
models,
 
but
 
remember
 
to
 
not
 
delete
 
"model_data.json"
 
and
 
"model_name_mapper.json"
 
as
 
they
 
cover
 
models
 
added
 
to
 
Download
 
Center
 
or
 
written
 
to
 
be
 
recognized
 
automatically
 
by
 
UVR,
 
so
 
it’s
 
rather
 
not
 
a
 
place
 
you
 
look
 
for.
 
Also,
 
you
 
can
 
decode
 
hashed
 
json
 
names
 
corresponding
 
to
 specific  models  here.   Layers  error -  for  issues  with  Unwa  400MB  model   -“First  make  sure  you're  running  the  latest  patch.  If  you're  on  the  latest  patch,  It  might  be

resetting

  Go  into  the  mdx_c_configs  folder  Find  and  delete  BS_Inst_EXP_VRL.yaml  Go  back  into  the  "Download  Center"  Select  "MDX-Net"  and  give  it  a  moment.  Close  the  Download  Center  and  try  again.   If  that  doesn't  work,  you  might  have  a  previous  json  model  file  that's  interfering:   Select  the  model  in  the  MDX-Net  model  menu  Then  select  "Edit  Model  Config"  From  the  popup,  click  "Reset  Parameters"”  Anjok  
Layers  errors  -  general  a)  You  didn’t  install  the  newest  patch  and  still  use  e.g.  beta  2  with  some  newer  model  b)  You  could  check  Roformer  v2  instead  of  v1  during  installing  custom  model  
TypeError:  (...)  freqs_per_bands  You  probably  set  Mel-Roformer  model  type  instead  of  BS-Roformer  when  it  was  necessary.  Go  to  MDX-Net,  pick  the  model>Edit  model  config>Choose  parameters.   There  you  should  change  Model  type.
