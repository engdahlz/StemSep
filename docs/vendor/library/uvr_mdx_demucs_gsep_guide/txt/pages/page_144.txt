     Dango.ai  scores  bad  in  SDR  leaderboards  due  to  recovery  algorithms  applied.  Similar  
situation
 
probably
 
like
 
in
 
GSep.
  -  New  BVE  model  on  X-Minus  for  premium  users.  One  of,  if  not  the  best  so  far.  It  uses  voc_ft  
as
 
a
 
preprocessor.
 
 "BVE  sounds  good  for  now  but  being  an  (u)vr  model  the  vocals  are  soft  (it  doesn’t  extract  
hard
 
sounds
 
like
 
K,
 
T,
 
S
 
etc.
 
very
 
well)"
 "Pretty  good,  if  still  [in]  training.  Seems  to  begin  a  phrase  with  a  bit  of  confusion  between  
lead
 
and
 
backing,
 
but
 
then
 
kicks
 
in
 
with
 
better
 
separation
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
phrase.
 
Might
 
just
 
be
 
the
 
sample
 
I
 
used,
 
though."
  -  Jarredou  published  the  final  2.2  version of  MDX23  Colab  (don't  confuse  it  with  MDX23C  single  models  v3  arch)  -  gives  more  vocal  residues  than  2.0/2.1,  but  better  SDR.  Now  it  has  
SRS
 
trick,
 
bigshifts,
 
new
 
fine-tuning,
 
separated
 
overlap
 
parameters
 
for
 
MDX,
 
MDXv3
 
and
 
Demucs
 
models,
 
and
 
also
 
possess
 
one
 
narrowband
 
MDX23C
 
model
 
D1581
 
among
 
other
 
MDX
 
ones,
 
which
 
states
 
a
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
models
 
now
 
(also
 
said
 
to
 
use
 
VOC-FT
 
Fullband
 
SRS
 
instead
 
of
 
UVR-MDX-Instr-HQ3,
 
although
 
HQ3
 
is
 
still
 
listed
 
during
 
processing).
 
You
 
can
 
also
 
use

optional
 
2
 
stem
 
only
 
output
 
(demucs_ft
 
vocal
 
stem
 
is
 
used
 
here
 
only).

32-bit.
 
Don’t
 
set
 
overlap
 
v3
 
to
 
more
 
than
 
10,
 
or
 
you’ll
 
get
 
error.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
way
 
more
 
frequent
 
with
 
odd
 
values.
 
  Changing  weights  added:  “For  residues,  I  would  first  try  a  different  weight  balance,  with  less  
MDXv3
 
and
 
more
 
VOC-FT,
 
as
 
model
 
D1581,
 
and
 
current
 
MDXv3
 
models
 
in

tend
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
residues
 
than
 
VOC-FT.”
  -  New  "8K  FFT  full  band"  model  published  on  MVSEP.  Currently,  a  better  score  than  only  2.2  
Colab
 
above
 
from
 
commonly
 
available
 
solutions,
 
although
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
current
 
default
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
and
 
“voice
 
sounded
 
more
 
natural
 
[in
 
default]
 
than
 
the
 
new
 
10
 
SDR
 
model”
 
but
 
in
 
some
 
problematic
 
songs
 
it
 
can
 
even
 
give
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
so
 
far.
  "Sometimes  8K  FFT  model  is  false  detect  the  vocals,  in  the  vocal  stem  synth  was  treated  as

On

mostly
 
are

result
 
compared
 
with
 
12K
 
FFT.
 
But
 
12K
 
FFT
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
some
 
vocal
 
residue
 
but
 
very
 
less
 
heard
 
(like
 
a
 
whisper)
 
and
 
happened
 
for
 
several
 
songs,
 
not
 
all
 
songs."
