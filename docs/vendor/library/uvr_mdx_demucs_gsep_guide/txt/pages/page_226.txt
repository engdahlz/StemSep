    Place  the  model  file  in  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\VR_Models  and  config  file  in  
lib_v5\vr_network\modelparams
 
(if
 
doesn’t
 
exist
 
already).
 
Then
 
pick
 
“4band_v4_ms_fullband.json”
 
and
 
BV
 
when
 
asked
 
to
 
recognize
 
the
 
model
 
(it
 
has
 
the
 
same
 
checksum
 
as
 
in
 
modelparams
 
folder
 
if
 
it’s
 
there
 
already).
 
Seems
 
like
 
it
 
works
 
with
 
“VR
 
5.1
 
model”
 
checked
 
(and
 
probably
 
without
 
it
 
too).
 “Note  that  this  model  should  be  used  with  a  rebalanced  mix.   The  recommended  music  level  is  no  more  than  25%  or  -12  dB.  If  you  use  this  model  in  your  project,  please  credit  me.”  
(it's
 
v1
 
version
 
is
 
also
 
added
 
in
 
UVR’s
 
“Download
 
More
 
Models”,
 
but
 
also
 
without
 
stereo
 
width
 
feature
 
which
 
can
 
fix
 
some
 
issues
 
when
 
BVs
 
are
 
confused
 
with
 
other
 
vocals).
 On  x-minus  “When  you  select  stereo,  it  applies  a  stereo  narrower  before  AI  processing.”  It  used  to  be  one  of  the  best  models  for  this  purpose.  On  x-minus  at  certain  point  it  used  
voc_ft
 
for
 
all
 
vocals
 
as
 
a
 
preprocessor
 
already
 
(not
 
sure
 
if
 
it
 
got
 
changed).
 "BVE  sounds  good  for  now  but  being  an  (u)vr  model  the  vocals  are  soft  (it  doesn’t  extract  
hard
 
sounds
 
like
 
K,
 
T,
 
S
 
etc.
 
very
 
well)"
 
 "Seems  to  begin  a  phrase  with  a  bit  of  confusion  between  lead  and  backing,  but  then  kicks  in  
with
 
better
 
separation
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
phrase."
 “If  something  struggles  to  separate  on  bve  v2  I  change  the  lv  panning  option  to  either  50  or  
80%
 
[stereo
 
or
 
center],
 
and
 
it
 
separates
 
it
 
amazingly.
 It  even  allows  me  to  separate  backing  backing  vocals  from  backing  vocals”

  -  Newer  Gabox  experimental  Karaoke  model (June  2025).  It’s  one  stem  target  so  keep  extract_instrumental  enabled  for  the  rest  stem.  “really  hard  to  tell  the  difference  between  this  and  becruily's  karaoke  model”  minus  the  latter  
has
 
more
 
target
 
stems.
  -  Chain  ensemble  mode  for  B.V.  models  (available  on  x-minus.pro for  premium  users,  added  in  UVR  beta  5.5/9.15  beta  patch already):   It  is  possible  to  recreate  this  approach  using  non-BVE  v2  models  in  UVR  by  processing  the  
output
 
of
 
one
 
Karaoke
 
model
 
by
 
another
 
(possibly
 
VR
 
model
 
as
 
the
 
latter)
 
with
 
Settings>Additional
 
Settings>Vocal
 
Split
 
Mode
 
option
 
(so
 
it
 
separates
 
using
 
the
 
main
 
model
 
for
 
all
 
vocals,
 
then
 
it
 
uses
 
the
 
result
 
as
 
input
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
model).
 So  you  might  experiment  with  using  voc_ft  or  Kim  Vocal  2  or  1296  as  the  main  vocal  model  
in
 
the
 
main
 
UVR
 
window,
 
and
 
in
 
Vocal
 
Split
 
Mode
 
use
 
HP5
 
or
 
HP6
 
or
 
BVE
 
model,
 
so
 
you
 
won’t
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
process
 
in
 
2
 
steps
 
manually,
 
so
 
separating
 
the
 
result
 
with
 
another
 
model
 
once
 
the
 
first
 
separation
 
is
 
done.
