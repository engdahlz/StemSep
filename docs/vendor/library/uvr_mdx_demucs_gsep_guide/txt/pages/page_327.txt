     TL;DR  -  "Usually  MDX  B  Karaoke  has  really  good  lead  vocals  and  UVR  Karaoke  has  really  
good
 
backing
 
vox”
  "There  are  3  good  karaoke  models  (the  ones  I'm  referring  to  are  on  mvsep.com  [they  seem  
to
 
be
 
no
 
longer
 
available
 
there]).
 
"MDX
 
B
 
(Karaoke)"
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
at
 
getting
 
lead
 
vocals
 
from
 
karaoke
 
while
 
"karokee_4band_v2_sn"
 
(UVR)
 
and
 
"HP_KAROKEE-MSB2-3BAND-3090"
 
(UVR)
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
best
 
for
 
backing
 
vocals.
 
I
 
recommend
 
using
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
the
 
3
 
to
 
get
 
as
 
many
 
layers
 
as
 
possible,
 
and
 
then
 
use
 
Melodyne
 
to
 
extract
 
layers
 
as
 
best
 
as
 
possible.
 
Then
 
combine
 
the
 
filter
 
results
 
and
 
Melodyne
 
and
 
you
 
should
 
have
 
smthn
 
that
 
sounds
 
pretty
 
good"
 
karokee_4band_v2_sn
 
model
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
compatible
 
with
 
Colab
 
(check
 
mvsep
 
or
 
UVR5
 
GUI)
  -  Demix  Pro  may  do  a  better  job  in  B.V.  than  models  on  x-minus.  Even  than  the  new  model  on  x-minus  since  01.02.23,  but  might  be  worth  trying  out  on  some  
songs
 
(the
 
problem
 
is
 
probably
 
bound
 
to
 
MDX
 
architecture
 
itself).
  "MDX  in  its  pure  form  is  too  aggressive  and  removes  a  lot  of  backing  vocals.  However,  if  we  
apply
 
min_mag_k
 
processing,
 
the
 
results
 
become
 
closer
 
to
 
Demix
 
Pro"
  -  Medley  Vox  (installation  tutorial)  For  separating  different  voices,  including  harmonies  or  backing  vocals  check  out  this  vocal  
separator,
 
the
 
demos
 
sound
 
quite
 
good
 
and
 
Cyrus
 
model
 
has
 
pretty
 
similar
 
results.
 It's  for  already  separated  or  original  acapellas.  Sometimes  it  gives  better  results  than  BVE  
models.
