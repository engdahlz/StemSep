    It  takes  around  30  seconds  for  one  song.  It  was  1.272  USD  for  separating  1  stem  out  MVSEP's  multisong  dataset  (100  tracks  x  1  
minute).
  -  (outdated)  Using  Ripple  on  an  M1  remote  machine  turned  out  to  be  successful  but  very  
convoluted.

  -How  to  change  region  to  US  in  Apple  App  Store  to  make  "Ripple  -  Music  Creation  Tool"  (SAMI-Bytedance)  work.  https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201389  https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-us Or  use  this Walmart  address  in  Texas,  the  number  belongs  to  an  airport.  Do  it  in  App  Store  (where  you  have  the  person-icon  in  top  right).  You  don't  have  to  fill  credit  cards  details,  when  you  are  rejected,  reboot,  check  region/country...  and  it  can  be  set  to  the  US  already.  Although,  it  can  happen  for  some  users  that  it  won't  let  you  download  anything  forcing  your  
real
 
country.
  "I  got  an  error  because  the  zip  code  was  wrong  (I  did  enter  random  numbers)  and  it  got  
stuck
 
even
 
after
 
changing
 
it.
 So  I  started  from  the  beginning,  typed  in  all  the  correct  info,  and  voilà"   If  ''you  have  a  store  credit  balance;  you  must  spend  your  balance  before  you  can  change  
stores''.
  It  needs  (an  old?)  a  sim  card  to  log  your  old  account  out  if  necessary.   -  Long  awaited  app  made  by  Bytedance  with  one  of  their  SAMI  variants  from  MDX23
