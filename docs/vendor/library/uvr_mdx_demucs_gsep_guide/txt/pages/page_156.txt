    you’ve  redeemed  your  code  https://www.buymeacoffee.com/uvr5/vip-model-download-instructions Or  use  Colab.  Newer  epochs  available  for  paid users  of  https://x-minus.pro/ai?hp&test-mdx  -  To  use  Colabs  in  mobile  browsers,  you  probably  no  longer  need  to  switch  your  browser  to  
PC
 
Mode
 
first.
  News  section  continues  in  older news/update  logs    General  reading  advice   -  If  you  found  this  document  elsewhere  (e.g.  as  PDF),  here is  always  up-to-date  version  of  the  doc   -  If  you  have  anything  to  add  to  this  doc,  ping  me  @deton24  on  our  Discord  server from  the  footer,  but  rather  refrain  from  PMing  directly  if  not  necessary.  Every  time  you  request  writing  privileges  via  GDoc,  
God
 
kills
 
a
 
cat.
 
Don't
 
click
 
“ask
 
for
 
privileges”!
  -  You  can  use  the  (rather  outdated)  Table  of  content section,  but  better  go  to  Options  and  show  “ Document  outline ”  to  see  an  up-to-date  clickable  table  of  content.  If  you  don't  have  Google  Docs  
installed,
 
and
 
you
 
opened
 
the
 
doc
 
in
 
a
 
mobile
 
browser
 
and
 
no
 
Table
 
of
 
content
 
option
 
appear,
 
use
 Table  of  content or  go  to  options  of  the  mobile  browser  and  run  the  site  in  PC  mode  to  show  document  outline  (but  it's  better  to  have  Google  Docs  installed  on  your  phone  instead  as  it’s  more  
convenient
 
in
 
use).
 -  Sometimes  you  cannot  scroll  down  the  list  of  headings  on  the  phone  in  PC  mode.  Then  you  need  to  
tap
 
on
 
the
 
scroll
 
bar
 
in
 
the
 
very
 
left,
 
but
 
it
 
might
 
suddenly
 
look
 
buggy
 
all
 
highlighted,
 
but
 
working
 
nevertheless.
 
 -  Downloaded  .docx  will  have  a  similar  document  outline  as  in  the  GDoc  (but  more  messy  -  with  all  
headers
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
GDoc).
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
an
 
error
 
on
 
attempt
 
of
 
opening
 
the
 
.docx
 
file
 
on
 
Windows,
 
go
 
to
 
RBM>Properties
 
and
 
check
 
Unlock
 
below
 
Attributes.
  -  Be  aware  that  the  document  can  hang  for  a  while  on  the  attempt  of  accessing  a  specific  section  of  
the
 
document
 
-
 
it
 
doesn't
 
happen
 
often
 
on
 
a
 
PC
 
browser
 
-
 
it’s
 
the
 
most
 
stable
 
form
 
of
 
reading
 
the
 
doc
 
online.
 
At
 
least
 
on
 
a
 
decent
 
PC
 
(so
 
not
 
C2Q,
 
but
 
even
 
a
 
decade
 
old
 
i7
 
is
 
usually
 
fine).
 
But
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
stable
 
on
 
Android
 
phone
 
too
 
(e.g.
 
Snapdragon
 
700
 
series
 
instead
 
of
 
old
 
400
 
series).
 
Google’s
 
app
 
support
 
for
 
old
 
32-bit
 
ROMs
 
in
 
e.g.
 
Android
 
9
 
and
 
older
 
is
 
terrible.
  -  Search  and  navigating  through  the  document  outline  works  faster  when  you  download  the  doc  as  
.pdf
 
or
 
.docx,
 
but
 
in
 
the
 
latter
 
you’ll
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
document
 
outline
 
on
 
the
 
left
 
like
 
in
 
GDoc
 
(if
 
not,
 
press
 
CTRL+F>Headings,
 
or
 
check
 
View>Navigation
 
window).
 
  -  When  visiting  the  online  version  of  the  doc,  you  can  paste  whole  phrase  when  searching  instead  of  
single
 
letters
 
to
 
avoid
 
severe
 
stuttering
 
during
 
using
 
search
 
function
 
online.
