    -  Gabox  released  new  INSTV8N instrumental  model  in  experimental  folder  (yaml)  “noticed  too  many  vocal  residues.  (...)  there  is  no  noise”  although  N  stands  for  noise  in  its  
name.
  -  Some  upscaling  Colabs  are  also  affected  by  the  last  runtime  changes  in  Colab  made  by  
Google.
 
Maybe
 
downgrading
 
!pip
 
install
 
torch==2.5
 
would
 
help.
  -  We're  aware  of  the  issues  in  some  Colabs  like  MDX  by  HV (numpy  errors  related  to  its  wrong  version).  Any  fixing  will  be  announced.  Stay  tuned.  -  Fixed,  but  initialization  is  slow  till  further  notice,  and  you  need  to  click  initialization  cell  
second
 
time
 
when
 
you’re
 
prompted
 
to
 
restart
 
environment.
 
-
 
Fixed,
 
but
 
now
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
click
 
the
 
initialization
 
cell
 
again
 
after
 
Numpy
 
has
 
been
 
installed
 
(happens
 
briefly
 
after
 
launching
 
the
 
initialization
 
cell).
  -  Unwa's  FT3  test  vocal  model  added  on  x-minus/uvronline  “make  vocals  sound  a  bit  lower  at  chorus  compared  to  other  parts  of  songs”,  doesn’t  happen  
with
 
big
 
beta

  -   ZFTurbo:  “I  added  2  new  super  resolution  algorithms  on  MVSep  in  Experimental  section:  1)  AudioSR.  Metrics:  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/8067 2)  FlashSR.  Metrics:  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/8071”  Be  aware  that  both  can  give  some  errors  occasionally.  Some  problems  with  mono  audio  
were
 
fixed
 
already.
  -  Unwa  released  FT3  preview  vocal  model |  yaml Vocal  bleedless:  36.11,  fullness:  16.80,  SDR:  11.05   “primarily  aimed  at  reducing  leakage  of  wind  instruments  to  vocals.  I  will  upload  a  further  fine-tuned  version  as  FT3  in  the  near  future.”  For  now,  FT2  has  less  leakage  for  some  songs  (maybe  till  the  next  FT  will  be  released).   -  Gabox  added  some  new  experimental  instrumental  models  in  a  separate  repo  folder.  They  are  called  V8,  V9,  V10,  don’t  consider  them  as  newer/better,  but  forgotten  to  upload  in  
the
 
meantime.
 
They’re
 
less
 
full
 
than
 
V7,
 
but
 
have
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
Also,
 
the
 
results
 
from
 
V8
 
and
 
V10
 
are
 
the
 
same
 
(“inverted
 
polarity
 
between
 
2
 
results,
 
and
 
it's
 
just
 
silence”),
 
and
 
also
 
for
 
V9.
 
“Both
 
remove
 
some
 
instruments
 
from
 
the
 
music,
 
like
 
V7.
 As  for  noise,  however,  they  are  less  noisy”   -  Gabox  released  inst_gaboxBv3 instrumental  model  (B  for  bleedless)  Inst.  bleedless:  41.69,  fullness:  32.13  “can  be  muddy  sometimes”   -  mesk’s  training  model  guide link  has  been  changed  (the  previous  one  has  been  deleted)
