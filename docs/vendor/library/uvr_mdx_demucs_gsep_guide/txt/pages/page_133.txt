    If  you  stuffer  from  some  vocal  residues,  try  out  these  settings  BigShifts_MDX:  0  overlap_MDX:  0.65  overlap_MDXv3:  10  overlap  demucs:  0.96  output_format:  float  vocals_instru_only:  disabled   Also,  you  can  manipulate  with  weights.  E.g.  different  weight  balance,  with  less  MDXv3  and  more  VOC-FT.   -  As  an  addition  to  AI-killing  tracks section,  and  in  response  to  deletion  of  "your  poor  results"  channel,  there  was  recently  created  a  Gsheet with  your  problematic  tracks  to  fill  in.

MD  serves  to  separation  of  various  singers  from  a  track.  It  
sometimes
 
does
 
a
 
better
 
job
 
than
 
BVE
 
models
 
in
 
general.
 
  Sadly,  it  has  24kHz  output  sample  rate,  but  AudioSR  works  pretty  good  for  upscaling  the

  -  "Ensemble  4/8  algorithms  were  updated  on  MVSep  with  new  VitLarge23  model.  All  quality  
metrics
 
were
 
increased:
 Multisong  Vocals:  10.26  ->  10.32  Multisong  Instrumental:  16.52  ->  16.63  Synth  Vocals:  12.42  ->  12.67  Synth  Instrumental  12.12  ->  12.38  MDX23  Leaderboard:  11.063  ->  11.098   I  added  Ensemble  All-In  algorithm  which  includes  additionally  piano,  guitar,  lead/back  vocals.  
Piano
 
and
 
guitar
 
has
 
better
 
metrics
 
comparing
 
to
 
standard
 
models,
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
extracted
 
from
 
high
 
quality
 
"other"
 
stem.
 
Lead/back
 
vocals
 
also
 
has
 
slightly
 
better
 
metrics.
