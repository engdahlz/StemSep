    Strangely,  the  best  SDR  for  aggressiveness  using  MSB2  instrumental  model  turned  out  to  be  
100
 
in
 
GUI,
 
10
 
in
 
Colab,
 
while
 
we
 
usually
 
used
 
0.3
 
for
 
this
 
model
 
and
 
500m_x
 
as
 
well,
 
while
 
HP
 
models
 
usually
 
behaves
 
the
 
best
 
with
 
lower
 
values
 
than
 
HP2
 
models
 
(0.09/10
 
in
 
GUI).
  -  Mirroring  turned  out  to  enhance  SDR.  It  adds  to  the  spectrum  e.g.  above  20kHz  for  a  base  
training
 
frequency
 
of
 
VR
 
model
 
(all
 
4
 
bands).
      none  -  No  processing  (default)      bypass  -  This  copies  the  missing  frequencies  from  the  input.      mirroring  -  This  algorithm  is  more  advanced  than  correlation.  It  uses  the  high  frequencies  
from
 
the
 
input
 
and
 
mirrored
 
instrumental's
 
frequencies.
 
More
 
aggressive.
     mirroring2  -  This  version  of  mirroring  is  optimized  for  better  performance.   -- high_end_process  -  In  the  old  CLI  VR,  this  argument  restored  the  high  frequencies  of  the  
output
 
audio.
 
It
 
was
 
intended
 
for
 
models
 
with
 
a
 
narrow
 
bandwidth
 
-
 
16
 
kHz
 
and
 
below
 
(the
 
oldest
 
“lowend”
 
and
 
“32000”
 
ones,
 
none
 
more).
 
But
 
now
 
in
 
UVR5
 
GUI,
 
High-end
 
process
 
is
 
counterpart
 
of
 
mirroring.
  (current  500MB  models  don’t  have  full  22kHz  coverage,  but  20kHz,  so  consider  using  
mirroring
 
instead
 
or
 
none
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
fuller
 
spectrum)
  -  Be  aware,  that  even  for  VR  arch,  the  same  rule  for  GPUs  with  less  than  8GB  VRAM  
applies
 
(inb4
 
-
 
Colab
 
T4
 
has
 
15GB)
 
-
 
separations
 
on
 
6GB
 
VRAM
 
have
 
worse
 
quality
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
parameters.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
work
 
around
 
the
 
issue,
 
you
 
can
 
split
 
your
 
audio
 
into
 
specific
 
parts
 
(e.g.
 
for
 
all
 
chorus,
 
verses
 
etc).
  
VR  models  settings  and  list   For  VR  architecture  models,  you  can  start  with  these  two  fast  models:   Model:  HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m  (1_HP-UVR)   1)  Fast  and  reliable.  V2  below  has  more  “polished”  drums,  while  here  they’re  more  
aggressive
 
and
 
louder.
 
Sometimes
 
V2
 
might
 
be
 
safer
 
and
 
can
 
fit
 
in
 
more
 
cases
 
where
 
it’s
 
not
 
hip-hop
 
and
 
music
 
is
 
not
 
drum
 
oriented,
 
but
 
that
 
one
 
rarely
 
harms
 
some
 
instruments
 
more
 
in
 
certain
 
cases
 
with
 
more
 
busy
 
mix
 
with
 
e.g.
 
repeatable
 
synth.
 
You
 
may
 
want
 
to
 
isolate
 
using
 
these
 
two
 
models
 
and
 
pick
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
on
 
even
 
the
 
same
 
album.
