    -  Yusuf  fixed  Apollo and  AudioSR WebUI  Colabs  and  mid/side  method  of  upscaling  was  added  to  Apollo   -  Unwa  released  Big  Beta  6X  vocal  model (yaml)  Vocal  bleedless:  35.16,  fullness:  17.77,  SDR:  11.12   “it  is  probably  the  highest  SDR  or  log  wmse  score  in  my  model  to  date.”  
Some
 
leaks
 
into
 
vocal
 
might
 
occur.
 “dim  512,  depth  12.  It  is  the  largest  Mel-Band  Roformer  model  I  have  ever  uploaded.”  “I've  added  dozens  of  samples  and  songs  that  use  a  lot  of  them  to  the  dataset”   -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  new  Apollo  model  with  Aura  MR  STFT:  22.42  It's  available  under  "Apollo  Enhancers  (by  JusperLee  and  Lew)"  with  option:   
"Universal
 
Super
 
Resolution
 
(by
 
MVSep
 
Team)".
 It  requires  a  hard  cutoff  on  frequency  for  best  experience.”  -  ZFTurbo  Iirc,  it  was  trained  by  his  student.   “It's  doing  well  on  more  transient  stuff  like  snare  hits,  but  it  seems  to  really  struggle  to  
actually
 
add
 
harmonics.
 
Has
 
this
 
really
 
weird
 
quality
 
of
 
sounding
 
high
 
quality
 
and
 
low
 
quality
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time”
 “It  doesn't  seem  to  like  8  kHz  cutoff,  it  has  generated  almost  nothing”  “I  tried  with  a  10  kHz  cutoff  and  just  got  quitet-ish  transients”  “Lew  told  me  the  same  while  training  his,  the  model  would  learn  transients/drums  but  
struggle
 
with
 
harmonics.
 
Maybe
 
it’s
 
an
 
Apollo
 
limitation.
 
I
 
don’t
 
recall
 
if
 
the
 
OG
 
model
 
by
 
jusper
 
lee
 
has
 
this
 
issue
 
too,
 
since
 
it
 
rarely
 
works”
  Advice  You  might  want  to  process  your  song  even  4  times  to  potentially  get  better  results.  Also,  you  can  split  mids  and  sides,  and  upscale  them  separately  to  get  better  results,  although  it’s  not  always  better  solution  (spectrograms |  tutorial),  thx  AG89.  Using  e.g.  MDX23C  Similarity/Phantom  Centre  extraction  model  instead  with  2x  slowdown  
(to
 
reduce
 
smearing
 
artefacts)
 
gives
 
less
 
high-end
 
recovery,
 
but
 
less
 
noise
 
resulting
 
in
 
more
 proper  cancelling  of  both  channels  (spectrograms by  AG89).  Avg  ensemble  will  be  rather  diminishing  returns,  so  consider  manual  weighted  ensemble  in  
DAW.
 
Getting
 
rid
 
of
 
noise
 
or
 
dithering
 
above
 
real
 
frequencies
 
by
 
making
 
cutoff
 
can
 
make
 
a
 
night
 and  day  difference  for  the  result  (example)  Sometimes  cutting  off  some  more  existing  frequencies  might  be  beneficial  too  (the  model  
was
 
trained
 
with
 
hard
 
cutoff)
 For  noise  artefacts  after  upscaling  you  can  use  some  denoisers
