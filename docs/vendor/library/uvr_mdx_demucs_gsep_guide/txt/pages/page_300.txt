[page 300/642]
    It  can  happen  that  after  importing  three  stems  from  MDX23  or  other  arch,  into  the  same  
session,
 
all
 
combined
 
they
 
sound
 
so
 
loud
 
that
 
they
 
clip
 
on
 
the
 
master
 
fader.
 
I’d
 
rather
 
suggest
 
that,
 
in
 
many
 
cases
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
ignored,
 
as
 
after
 
mixdown
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
fine
 
in
 
most
 
cases
 
and
 
better
 
than
 
with
 
using
 
limiter,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
loudness
 
of
 
how
 
much
 
clipping
 
even
 
the
 
instrumental
 
from
 
single
 
model
 
will
 
have:
  37.  Q:  Why  sometimes  separated  instrumentals  have  clipping?   A:  “Mixture  doesn't  clip,  but  instrumental  is  clipping.   This  is  because  where  the  instrumental  is  clipping  in  positive  values,  the  vocals  are  in  
negative
 
values,
 
and
 
so
 
vocals
 
are
 
lowering
 
instrumental
 
peak
 
value
 
when
 
mixed
 
together.
  If  you  separate  a  song  peaking  at  0  with  high  loudness,  the  instrumental  will  probably  clip  
because
 
of
 
this
 
(and
 
the
 
more
 
loudness,
 
the
 
more
 
chances
 
this
 
clipping
 
can
 
happen,
 
as
 
waveform
 
is
 
brickwalled
 
toward
 
boundaries
 
values).
 
It's
 
the
 
laws
 
of
 
physics,
 
as
 
that's
 
because
 
of
 
these
 
laws
 
that
 
audio
 
phase/polarity
 
inversion
 
works.
  That's  why  Demucs  is  using  the  "clamp"  thing,  or  can  also  lower  the  volume  of  the  separated  
stem
 
to
 
avoid
 
that
 
clipping.
  -  Most  of  the  time,  lowering  your  input  by  3dB  solves  that  issue.    -  Saving  your  audio  to  float32  can  be  a  solution,  as  "clipped"  audio  data  is  not  lost  in  this  
case”
 
(jarredou)
 So  theoretically  in  32-bit  float,  the  volume  can  be  decreased  after  separation  and  still  nothing  
is
 
lost,
 
and
 
clipping
 
should
 
be
 
fixed.
  38.  Separated  audio  using  MDX-Net  arch  has  noise  when  mixture  has  no  audio  and  is  silent   Use  denoise  standard  (or  denoise  model)  in  Options>Choose  Advanced  Menu>Advanced

  39.  MDX23C/BS-Roformer  models  ringing  issue   “It  was  reported  that  maybe  DC  offset  can  amplify  it.  Fixing  it  with  RX  before  separation  was  said  to  alleviate  the  issue”  See  the  screenshot how  to  do  it,  “Don't  forget  to  use  "mix"  pasting  mode”  -  jarredou   It  serves  to  alleviate  the  issue  of  horizontal  lines  in  specific  frequencies  across  the  whole  
track,
 
cause
 
most
 
likely
 
by
 
bandsplitting
 
neural
 
network
 
artifacts.
 
Problem
 
presented
 
above.
  Q:  Mine  is  0.047%  for  the  DC  offset,  so  I  would  just  do  0.047  or  0.04  A:  “0.047%  is  kind  of  normal  value,  it's  even  a  great  one.  No  need  to  fix  that.  I  don't  know  at  what  value  it  could  be  become  problematic  for  source  separation  models.
