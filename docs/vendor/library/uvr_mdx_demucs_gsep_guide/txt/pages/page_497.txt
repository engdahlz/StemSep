Dolby  Atmos  ripping  “Streamed  Dolby  Atmos  is  eac  (5.1  Surround)  and  JOC  (Joint  Object  coding)  it's  a  hybrid  file  
of
 
channels
 
and
 
objects
 
that
 
decodes
 
the
 
5.1
 
+
 
joc
 
to
 
whatever
 
your
 
speakers
 
are
 
from
 
2.0
 
up
 
to
 
9.1.6.
 It's  not  a  multitrack,  although  clearly  what  some  mixers  do  is  put  all  the  vocal  in  the  center  
channel,
 
so
 
effectively
 
you
 
have
 
an
 
a
 
cappella
 
in
 
center
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
instrumental
 
in
 
everything
 
else,
 
but
 
many
 
labels
 
forbid
 
engineers
 
doing
 
it
 
and
 
have
 
policies
 
that
 
they
 
must
 
mix
 
other
 
sounds
 
into
 
center,
 
so
 
people
 
don't
 
rip
 
the
 
a
 
cappella.
 [“apparently  Logic  Pro  does  it  automatically  as  well”  isling,  src:  ScrepTure]  YouTube  only  supports  FOA  Ambisonics  as  spatial  audio,  but  you  can  encode  Dolby  Atmos  to  Ambisonics.  [by  e.g.  https://www.mach1.tech/]  Apple  Music  has  a  larger  amount  [of  Atmos  songs]  because  Apple  Pay  the  labels  for  
exclusive
 
Atmos
 
deals.”

  Tidal  only  supports  5.1  or  maybe  5.1.4,  and  Apple  Music  at  least  up  to  7.1.4  (9.1.6  support  
could
 
have
 
been
 
dropped
 
since
 
macOS
 
Sonoma,
 
not

“On
 
latest
 
MacOS
 
you
 
do
 
now
 
have
 
the
 
ability

7.1.4
 
pcm

  “I  tried  using  channels  from  an  Atmos  mix  to  get  better  instrumentals  and  very  surprisingly  it  
sounds
 
a
 
lot
 
worse
 I  rendered  it  into  7.1  and  upmixed  the  channels  into  3  separate  stereo  tracks,  and  processed  
each
 
using
 
unwa's
 
v1e+
 It  ended  up  sounding  more  muddy  than  using  a  lossless  stereo  mix”  -  santilli_
