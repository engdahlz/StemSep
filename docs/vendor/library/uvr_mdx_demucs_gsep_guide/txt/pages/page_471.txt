    Peel  Stems  https://products.zplane.de/products/peelstems/  VST  for  real  time  source  separation  (probably  same  models  like  in  MPC  stems)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Js5bWQWY7M   -  Service  rebranded  to   
Fadr.com  from  SongtoStems.com  is  just  Demucs  4  HT,  but  paid.  "My  assumption,  Fadr  uses  Gain  Normalize  [for  instrumentals]  was  right  [...].  Demucs  4  HT  seems  to  get  a  cleaner  result.  The  rest  =  practically  identical."  And  someone  
even
 
said
 
that
 
vocals
 
in
 
VirtualDJ
 
with
 
Stems
 
2.0
 
had
 
less
 
artifacts
 
on
 
vocals.
  
Apple  Music  Sing  “I  heard  a  few  snippets,  and  what  stood  out  is,  whether  intentional  or  not,  the  vocals  
remained
 
in
 
the
 
background
 
just
 
enough
 
to
 
actually
 
hear
 
them.
 Now  that  could  be  great  for  Karaoke,  so  u  have  a  kind  of  lead  to  go  on.”  but  as  for  just  
instrumentals,
 
it’s
 
bad.
  
Voxless  VST  “uses  AI  to  separate  vocals  and  instrumental  in  real  time.  Now  it  is  designed  to  be  used  
in
 
a
 
DAW,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
run
 
it
 
in
 
soundsource
 
[on
 
Mac,
 
or
 
probably
 
SAVIHost
 
(VST2/3)
 
or
 
Equalizer
 
APO
 
(VST3)
 
or
 
JBridge
 
on
 
Windows]
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
it
 
on
 
your
 
system
 
audio
 
live.
 
It
 
has
 
low
 
latency
 
and
 
doesn't
 
use
 
CPU
 
a
 
lot.
 
The
 
software
 
has
 
a
 
very
 
simple
 
interface,
 
just
 
two
 
knobs
 
to
 
increase/
 
decrease
 
the
 
instrumental
 
or
 
vocals
 
or
 
a
 
mute/solo
 
button
 
for
 
each.
 
As
 
for
 
the
 
quality
 
it
 
sounds
 
like
 
the
 
first
 
ever
 
days
 
of
 
audio
 
separation
 
with
 
AI
 
like
 
Demucs
 
v1
 
or
 
Spleeter
 
in
 
2019
 
-
 
2020
 
but
 
a
 
little
 
worse
 
somehow,
 
since
 
it
 
is
 
very
 
low
 
latency
 
not
 
CPU
 
heavy,
 
but
 
it
 
does
 
the
 
job.
 
Voxless
 
has
 
a
 
trial
 
of
 
7
 
days
 
if
 
you
 
wanna
 
check
 
it
 
but
 
the
 
license
 
costs
 
100$
 
which
 
I
 
think
 
is
 
quite
 
a
 
lot
 
for
 
a
 
software
 
that
 
separates
 
vocals
 
with
 
barely
 
first
 
gen
 
quality.”

Ozone  11  Master  Rebalance  “I  select  vocals  and  have  them  dialed  down  to  max  using  an  EQ  inside  of  it  (may  sound  
complicated,
 
so
 
you
 
gotta
 
watch
 
a
 
tutorial
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
ozone
 
works).
 
However,
 
the
 
results
 
were
 
far
 
from
 
voxless
 
quality.
 
It
 
leaves
 
so
 
much
 
bleed
 
and
 
whenever
 
vocals
 
are
 
quite
 
loud
 
you
 
can
 
barely
 
hear
 
anything
 
from
 
the
 
way
 
it's
 
fighting
 
it,
 
so
 
it
 
sounds
 
like
 
a
 
complete
 
mess.
 
Both
 
from
 
the
 
master
 
rebalance
 
and
 
the
 
main
 
AI
 
interface”
