[page 80/642]
    since  the  release  of  the  new  paid  site  and/or  maybe  didn’t  have  premium  since  then  (email  is  
from
 
July
 
9th,
 
so
 
3
 
months
 
after
 
the
 
release
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
site,
 
so
 
possibly
 
your
 
files
 
can
 
get
 
deleted
 
after
 
3
 
months
 
after
 
premium
 
was
 
disabled
 
on
 
your
 
account).
 
Normally,
 
new
 
separations
 
for
 
free
 
users
 
are
 
deleted
 
after
 
3
 
days
 
now,
 
but
 
older
 
files
 
were
 
preserved
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
accounts
 
using
 
beta
 
till
 
now.
 
The
 
account
 
wasn’t
 
used
 
since
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
October
 
2022.
 Check  your  mailbox  to  ensure,  I  didn’t  find  that  mail  in  spam  on  the  main  account  with  
premium,
 
so
 
hopefully
 
it’s
 
not
 
for
 
everyone
 
(at
 
least
 
not
 
for
 
those
 
with
 
premium
 
or
 
who
 
used
 
the
 
site
 
since
 
the
 
last
 
3
 
months):
 “All  files  from  Gaudio  Studio  will  be  deleted  on  August  7,  2024  [Wednesday].  (...)  If  you  
purchase
 
a
 
Studio
 
Plan,
 
your
 
files
 
will
 
be
 
preserved.”
 Be  aware  that  they  function  in  Japan,  which  is  GMT+9,  so  it’s  6  hours  sooner  than  CEST  
(Warsaw,
 
Skopje,
 
Zagreb).
 
 If  you  currently  have  premium,  you  can  download  all  your  previous  separations  in  WAV  
without
 
any
 
charge
 
(at
 
least
 
that’s
 
how
 
it
 
used
 
to
 
be),
 
without
 
premium
 
it
 
says
 
(misleadingly,
 
I
 
assume)
 
“The
 
song
 
processed
 
in
 
the
 
beta
 
service
 
do
 
not
 
support
 
WAV
 
file
 
downloads.”
 
but
 
probably
 
you’ll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
buy
 
premium
 
if
 
nothing
 
has
 
changed.
 
It’s
 
no
 
loner
 
possible,
 
and
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
references
 
to
 
WAV
 
in
 
dev
 
tools
 
as
 
before.
  -  Aufr33  released  files  of  his  Mel-Roformer  de-noise  models  publicly:  Less  aggressive &  More  aggressive |  yaml  file “If  you  will  use  this  model  in  your  project,  please  credit  me”  Added  in  jarredou  Colab too  (and  on  x-minus.pro/uvronline.app  for  premium  users  and  MVSEP).  Both  models  work  in  UVR  too  (don’t  forget  setting  overlap  to  2  to  avoid  stem  misalignment  
issues
 
like
 
for
 
other
 
Roformers
 
in
 
UVR
 
Roformer
 
beta,
 
overlap
 
3
 
or
 
above
 
will
 
break
 
separation)
  -  Jarredou  released  manual  ensemble  Colab  with  drop-down  menus  (based  on  ZFTurbo  
code)
 https://colab.research.google.com/github/jarredou/Music-Source-Separation-Training-Colab-Inference/blob/main/Manual_Ensemble_Colab.ipynb  -  To  fix  issues  with  BS  variant  of  anvuew’s  de-reverb  model  in  UVR  “change  stft_hop_length:  
512
 
to
 
stft_hop_length:
 
441
 
so
 
it
 
matches
 
the
 
hop_length
 
above”
 
in
 
the
 
yaml
 
file.
 
It
 
doesn’t
 
happen
 
on
  
(thx
 
lew).
  If  that  line  is  not  present  in  your  model  config  go  to  the  settings,  then  choose  MDX  In  the  
advanced
 
menu,
 
then
 
click
 
the
 
"clear
 
auto-set
 
cache"
 
button.
 Then  go  back  to  the  main  settings,  click  "reset  all  settings  to  default"  and  restart  the  app  (thx  
santilli_).
  -  If  you  still  have  error  on  every  attempt  of  using  GPU  Conversion  in  UVR  on  AMD  GPU  (you  
might
 
potentially
 
use
 
outdated
 
drivers
 
and/or
 
Windows),
 
go
 
to
 
Ultimate
 
Vocal
