    -  Be  aware  that  there  was  also  full  MPS  (GPU)  acceleration  introduced  for  Mac  M1  for  all  
MDX-NET
 
Original
 
Models
 
(HQ3,
 
etc.),
 
all
 
MDX23C
 
Models,
 
all
 
Demucs
 
v4
 
models
 
(no
 
VR
 
models
 
acceleration
 
on
 
GPU).
 
So
 
don’t
 
use
 
Windows
 
in
 
VM
 
to
 
run
 
UVR
 
anymore,
 
but
 separate  using  dmg  installer  from  releases section  (ARM).  GPU  acceleration  is  3x  faster  than  separation  took  on  CPU  before.   ____   -  “MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ  2  is  out  as  a  VIP  model  [for  UVR  5]!  It's  a  slightly  fine-tuned  version  
of
 
MDX23C-InstVoc
 
HQ.
 
The
 
SDR
 
is
 
a
 
tiny
 
bit
 
lower,
 
but
 
I
 
found
 
that
 
it
 
leaves
 
less
 
vocal
 
bleeding.”

 It’s  not  always  the  case,  sometimes  it  can  be  even  the  opposite,  but  as  always,  all  can  
depend
 
on
 
specific
 
song.
  -  jarredou’s  MDX23  2.2 Colab  should  allow  separating  faster,  and  also  longer  files  now  (tech  details)   -  All-in  ensemble  added  for  premium  users  of  MVSEP  -  it  has  vocals,  vocals  lead,  vocals  
back,
 
drums,
 
bass,
 
piano,
 
guitar,
 
other.
 
Basically
 
8
 
stems
 
(and
 
from
 
drums
 
stem
 
you
 
can
 further  separate  single  percussion  instruments  using  drumsep -  up  to  4  instruments,  so  it  will  give  10  stems  in  total).   -  https://www.capcut.cn/ (outdated  section:  read)  Is  a  new  Windows  app  which  contains  Ripple/SAMI-Bytedance  inst/vocal  model  (not  4  stems  
like
 
in
 
Ripple).
 “At  the  moment  the  separation  is  only  available  in  Chinese  version  which  is  jianyingpro,  download  at  capcut.cn  [probably  here -  it’s  where  you’re  redirected  after  you  click  “Alternate  download  link”  on  the  main  page,  where  download  might  not  work  at  all]  Separation  doesn't  require  sign  up/login,  but  exporting  does,  and  requires  VIP.  Separated  vocal  file  is  encrypted  and  located  in  
C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\JianyingPro\User
 
Data\Cache\audioWave”
  The  unencrypted  audio  file  in  AAC  format  is  located  at  \JianyingPro  
Drafts\yourprojectname\Resources\audioAlg
 
(ends
 
with
 
download.aac)
 Drag  and  drop  it  in  Audacity  or  convert  to  WAV  (https://cloudconvert.com/aac-to-wav)   “To  get  the  full  playable  audio  in  mp3  format  a  trick  that  you  can  do  is  drag  and  drop  the  
download.aac
 
file
 
into
 
capcut
 
and
 
then
 
go
 
to
 
export
 
and
 
select
 
mp3.
 
It
 
will
 
output
 
the
 
original
 
file
 
without
 
randomisation
 
or
 
skipping
 
parts”
  “Trying  out  Capcut,  the  quality  seems  the  same  as  the  Ripple  app  (low  bitrate  mp3  quality)  at  least  the  voice  leftover  bug  is  fixed,  lol”  Random  vocal  pops  from  Ripple  are  fixed  here.  Also,  it  still  has  the  same  clicks  every  25  seconds  as  before  in  Ripple.
