     jazzpear's  soon  to  be  17-stem  separation  Colab  (probably  doesn’t  work  anymore)  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jrw-cAi-JqZpBi6wyT3YIp3x-XHhDm1W   Similarity  Extractor  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WP5IjduTcc-RRsvfaFFIhnZadRhw-8ig But  Audacity's  center  extraction  which  can  be  used  also  online  works  better:  wavacity.com There  was  also  MDX23C  model  for  the  same  purpose  released:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/issues/1#issuecomment-2417116936  Useful  repositories   Python  command  line  fork  of  UVR  5  with  current  models  support  https://github.com/karaokenerds/python-audio-separator (it  used  to  have  the  same  broken  overlaps  from  UVR  for  Roformers)   OG  repo  on  which  jarredou’s  single  models  Colab  separation  is  made  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training (can  be  used  locally  both  for  inference  [separation]  and  training)   It  has  other  GUI  too:  https://github.com/AliceNavigator/Music-Source-Separation-Training-GUI  Using  only  CPU  in  the  GUI  might  be  fixed  by  changing  line  149  to   device  =  'cuda'  https://github.com/AliceNavigator/Music-Source-Separation-Training-GUI/blob/66ada053a623a20865cac7b9d26a02615204d178/inference.py#L148 ~frazer   WebUI:  https://github.com/SUC-DriverOld/MSST-WebUI  Other  GUI  for  UVR  https://github.com/TheStingerX/Ilaria-UVR   Good  paid  sites:   -  dango.ai (expensive,  one  of  the  best  results  for  instrumentals)  -  moises.ai (probably  in-house  BS-Roformer  models)  -  studio.gaudiolab.io (a.k.a.  GSEP,  still  good  for  specific  cases)
