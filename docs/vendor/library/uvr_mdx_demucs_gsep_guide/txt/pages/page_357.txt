    for  your  VRAM  and  RAM  configuration  (also  song  length),  so  the  result  will  differ  among  
various
 
users

the

Maximum
 
chunks
 
value
 
differ
 
for

MDX

will
 
allow
 
for
 
bigger
 
values
 
than
 
newer
 
Inst
 
models
 
with
 
higher
 
training
 
frequency).
 
You
 
can
 
test
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
maximum
 
supported
 
chunk
 
size
 
for
 
your
 
computer
 
specs
 
till
 
you
 
encounter
 
crash
 
(e.g.
 
for
 
5:11
 
song

for

model),
 
and
 
around

for
 
11GB).
 
Sweet

track
 
is
 
chunks

at
 
least
 
on
 
16GB
 
VRAM)
 
-
 
more
 
than
 
that
 
gives
 
worse
 
results.
 
Also
 
on
 
some
 
GPUs/configuration
 
you
 
may
 
notice
 
some
 
variations
 
in
 
very
 
short
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
not
 
(fully)
 
associated
 
with
 
chunks
 
which
 
don’t
 
happen
 
on
 
e.g.
 
x-minus
 
or
 
other
 
configurations
 
(1660
 
Ti
 
vs
 
1080
 
Ti
 
and
 
960
 
(we
 
don’t
 
know
 
what
 
causes
 
it).
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
you
 
can
 
only
 
alleviate
 
the
 
issue
 
by
 
changing
 
chunks.
 
Be
 
aware
 
that
 
low
 
maximum
 
chunks
 
on
 
4GB
 
cards
 
beside
 
more
 
sudden
 
vocal
 
residues
 
and
 
cuts
 
in
 
the
 
result,
 
may
 
cause
 
also
 
specific
 
artefacts
 
like
 
e.g.
 
beeping
 
not
 
existing
 
on
 
e.g.
 
11GB
 
card
 
(the
 
issue
 
happen
 
in
