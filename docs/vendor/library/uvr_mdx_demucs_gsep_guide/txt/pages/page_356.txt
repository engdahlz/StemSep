    A:  Change  primary  stem  from  whatever  it  is  set  to  the  opposite  in  model  options  (screenshot)   Q:  Matchering  gives  errors  with  long  files.  A:  14:44  input  length  limit  for  both  target  and  reference  audio  is  set,  and  sth  slightly  above  it  
caused
 
error
 
(probably
 
a
 
bit
 
above
 
15
 
mins,
 
so
 
maybe
 
15
 
minutes
 
is
 
a
 
limit).
 If  you  see  the  error  log,  it  will  specify  whether  the  reference  or  target  file  is  too  long,  but  the  
limit
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
both.
  Q:  “Is  there  any  way  to  batch-process  multiple  different  models  on  the  same  file?  A:  Yeah,  ensemble,  turn  individual  outputs  on  [in  options],  you'll  have  the  same  song  over  
and
 
over,
 
each
 
with
 
a
 
different
 
model
 
name
 
attached,
 
all
 
saved
 
before
 
the
 
final
 
min/max/avg
 
mix”
  If  you  drag  and  drop  many  files  at  the  same  time  into  the  input  field  and  save  intermediate  
files
 
in
 
options,
 
you
 
don't
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
manually
 
start
 
separation
 
for
 
every
 
song.
 
  The  feature  to  save  intermediate  files  is  probably  enabled  by  default  in  options>Choose  
Advanced>Ensemble>Save
 
all
 
outputs
 IDK  if  "Model  test  mode"  in  Options>Additional  is  necessary  for  it  (Settings  Test  Mode  can  be  
additionally
 
enabled
 
too,
 
just
 
in
 
case
 
something
 
gets
 
overwritten
 
by
 
accident
 
if
 
you
 
change
 
settings).
  So  you  can  simply  use  Ensemble  to  pick  all  models  you  want  to  batch  process,  and  using  
drag
 
and
 
drop,
 
to
 
separate
 
all
 
songs
 
you
 
want,
 
using
 
all
 
models
 
you
 
picked
 
in
 
the
 
Ensemble,
 
and
 
probably
 
intermediate
 
files
 
(so
 
from
 
the
 
models)
 
will
 
be
 
saved
 
rather
 
intact,
 
no
 
matter
 
what
 
ensemble
 
algorithm
 
you'll
 
use.
 
You
 
can
 
make
 
a
 
manual
 
ensemble
 
with
 
any
 
algorithm
 
with
 
existing
 
intermediate
 
files
 
later.
