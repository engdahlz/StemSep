    -  The  beta  patches  are  currently  only  for  Windows  (but  just  the  fb  403/450  models  can  be  
used
 
in
 
the
 
older
 
UVR
 
version,
 
and
 
it
 
works
 
correctly
 
-
 
the
 
patch
 
itself
 
is
 
an
 
exe
 
installer
 
which
 
has
 
the
 
model
 
inside
 
and
 
doesn't
 
check
 
for
 
current
 
UVR
 
installation)
  Update  14.02.23  "I  found  a  bug  in  the  MDX-NET.  If  the  input  song  contains  a  DC  offset,  there  will  be  a  lot  of  noise  in  the  output!  It  has  already  been  fixed  on  the  XM.  It  will  also  be  fixed  soon  in  the  next  UVR  GUI  update."  Examples   Update  11/12.02.23  "I  will  soon  add  a  new  setting  to  fine  tune  the  Karokee  /  B.V.  model.  This  will  help  remove  
**even
 
wide
 
stereo
 
lead
 
vocals**.
  "You  can  now  specify  the  placement  of  the  lead  vocal.  The  percentages  are  approximate  
vocal
 
wideness."
  Here is  the  current  result.  As  you  can  hear,  the  lead  vocals  are  hardly  removed  [in  the  old  setting]."   "this  is  super  cool,  if  you  invert  the  2  results  you  can  actually  get  the  stereo  width  vocals  
isolated
 1  step  closer  to  more  than  just  1  track  bgvox  separation"  "Ooo  that's  very  interesting,  stereo  lead  vocals  always  get  confused  for  background  ones"   Update  4.02.23  New  chain  ensemble  mode  for  B.V.  models  available  on  x-minus  "the  chain  is  the  best  bg  vox  filtering  I've  ever  heard"   "It  mixes  MDX  lead  vocal  and  a  little  bit  of  instruments.  The  resulting  mix  is  then  processed  
by
 
the
 
UVR
 
(b.v.)
 
v2
 
model
 
and
 
the
 
cleaned
 
lead
 
vocal
 
is
 
inverted
 
with
 
the
 
input
 
mix
 
(song).
  Unlike  min_mag  and  other  methods,  when  using  chain,  processing  is  sequential.  One  model  
processes
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
another
 
model.
 
That's
 
why
 
I
 
called
 
it
 
a
 
"chain"."

 New  Demucs  4  (probably  instrumental)  model  is  in  training.  edit.  training  stopped  due  to  
technical
 
issues
 
and
 
full
 
band
 
MDX
 
models
 
were
 
trained
 
instead.
