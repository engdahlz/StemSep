    The  best  models   
for  specific  stems  
 There's  no  such  thing  like  the  best  model.  It  depends  on  a  song,  even  in  specific  genre,  mixing,  effects,  etc.   
You
 
need
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
best
 
models
 
posted
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
here,
 
and
 
see
 
what
 
fits
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
your
 
song
 
or
 
cut
 
it
 
into
 
pieces
 
and/or
 check  ensembles.   -  Most  models  here  are  Mel-Roformer  and  BS-Roformer  model  type  in  the  compatible  UVR version  -  not  v2  model  type   (there's  only  one  V2  model  so  far);  don’t  confuse  it  with  e.g.  v2  versions/iterations  of  models  below,  which  are  just  their  names  -  Check  the  reading  about  SDR and  fullness
 
metric.  Evaluations are  made  on  the  multisong  dataset  on  MVSEP  (table  can  be  sorted  by  also  fullness/bleedless  and  other  metrics,  once  you  open  a  result,  fullness/bleedless  metrics  are  shown  too,  excluding  
old
 
results)

  Good  all-rounders  from  various  categories  (balanced,  fullness,  bleedless):   -  Becruily  dual  Mel-Roformer  “deux”  model  (instrumental  stem)  Compatible  with  UVR  Roformer  patch (including  the  RTX  5000  one)  |  Colab |  uvronline  Inst.  bleedless  41.36,  fullness  34.25,  SDR  17.55

 “more  bleedless  than  resurrection  inst  (...)  on  a  song  with  mostly  piano,  sounds  considerably  
less
 
muddy
 
than
 
resurrection
 
inst…
 
maybe
 
overall
 
slightly
 
more
 
noise...
 
but
 
the
 
noise
 
isn't
 
bothersome”,
 
(...)
 
deux
 
just
 
seems
 
to
 
make
 
some
 
things
 
super
 
muddy
 
and/or
 
break
 
them
 
up...
 
like
 
an
 
instrument
 
here
 
is
 
just
 
really
 
wobbly
 
with
 
deux,
 
probably
 
because
 
it
 
doesn't
 
have
 
the
 
fullness
 
required.
 Hyperace  sounds  better  in  areas  here,  but  noisy  in  others..  I  guess  you  really  gotta  use  all  3  
models
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
a
 
great
 
result”
 Resurrection  inst  seems  to  be  also  fuller  at  times,  but  while  being  also  noisier,  and  when  the  
song
 
has
 
the
 
noise
 
in
 
it
 
intentionally,
 
ress
 
inst
 
tend
 
to
 
pick
 
it
 
up.

 “Love  the  new  model,  besides  it  being  on  par  with  v1e  in  terms  of  fullness  (on  some  tracks  
it's
 
even
 
fuller)
 
without
 
the
 
noise
 
tradeoff,
 
it's
 
also
 
noticeably
 
better
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
bleedlessness
 
as
 
well,
 
it
 
managed
 
to
 
completely
 
remove
 
some
 
faint
 
choir/vocals
 
pretty
 
much
 
all
 
other
 
models
 
weren't
 
able
 
to
 
remove.
 
Most
 
definitely
 
my
 
favorite
 
model
 
so
 
far.”

 “I  think  V1E+  is  still  fuller,  sounds  more  open”  -  rainboomdash   On  uvronline  (not  sure  if  free  to)  “since  the  deux  model  creates  two  stems,  phase  correction  
is
 
now
