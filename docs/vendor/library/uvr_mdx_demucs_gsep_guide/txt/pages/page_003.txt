 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/entry/9475 “kept  the  chants  in  [one  song],  resurrection  inst  isn't  really  much  better,  though...  it  takes  a  high  vocal  fullness  model  to  extract  these  (like  fv7beta1,  even  fv7beta2  isn't  
enough),
 
maybe
 
that's
 
why
 
the

models
 
are
 
getting
 
confused...
 
Surprised
 
it's
 
still
 
very
 
much
 
there
 
with
 
resurrection
 
inst…
 I'm  surprised;  hyperacev2  fixed  vocal  bleed  on  one  song  compared  to  the  previous  version.  
Does
 
seem
 
like
 
vocal
 
bleed
 
with
 
hyperace
 
v2
 
is
 
a
 
bit
 
better
 it's  not  removed,  just  quieter  in  areas  where  it  did  happen”  -  rainboomdash  “picks  up  vocals  better  than  the  first  model,  but  along  with  the  vocals,  it  muffles  other  
instruments,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
synthesizer.”

  -  Previously  released  FNO  inst  model  by  unwa  now  has  a  separate  Colab #3  to  run  it   -  Along  with  the  inst  variant,  unwa  released  BS-Roformer  HyperAce  vocal  model v2   separate  Colab #2  |  makidanyee’s  Colab |  (incompatible  with  UVR,  use  MSST)  Voc.  bleedless  34.08,  fullness  19.10,  SDR  11.40’ (there  was  no  v1  variant  of  HyperAce)   “The  model  files  (bs_roformer.py)  for  v2_voc  and  v2_inst  are  the  same.”  “aims  to  outperform  Big  Beta  6X  overall,  and  I  believe  it  has  achieved  that  goal.  Scores  for  all  metrics  except  bleedless  and  log_wmse  have  improved  compared  to  6X.”  -

 Is  it  better  than  Beta  6X?  “hard  to  say,  imo,  tbh  it  has  some  added  noise,  especially  during  some  quieter  parts  that  big  beta  6x  doesn't  have.  
Noisier
 
in
 
those
 
areas
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
times
 
than
 
even
 
fuller
 
models.
 
unwa
 
thinks
 
it's
 
overall
 
better”

 “I  feel  like  most  songs  hyperace  gets  a  good  bleedless  result  but  ill  probably  stick  w  voc  fv7  
beta3
 
or
 
revive
