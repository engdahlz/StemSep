     -  Phase  remix  functionality  was  added  to  SESA  model  inference  Colab  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U28JyleuFEW6cNxQO_CRe0B2FbNoiEet  -  (MVSEP)  ZFTurbo  added  new  SCNet  XL  “high  fullness”  and  “very  high  fullness”  models  on  the  site  (metrics).  They’re  good  for  both  vocals  and  instrumentals,  and  sometimes  are  fuller  than  v1e,  although  
with
 
more
 
noise,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
too
 
strong
 
for
 
some
 
people,
 
but
 
not
 
all.
 “very  high  fullness”  variant  have  both  vocals  and  instrumental  fullness  and  bleedless  metric  
better
 
than
 
the
 
“high
 
fullness”.
 “they  also  correctly  detect  "complex"  (for  the  AI)  instruments  as  part  of  the  instrumental  track  
rather
 
than
 
in
 
vocals
 
(like
 
flute
 
or
 
sax
 
for
 
example),
 
which
 
isn't
 
the
 
case
 
for
 
v1e
 
and
 
Fv5.
 
Example:
 
sax
 
solo
 
of
 
Shine
 
On
 
You
 
Crazy
 
Diamond
 
detected
 
the
 
sax
 
solo
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
acapella
 
using
 
v1e
 
or
 
Fv5
 
or
 
becruily
 
inst.”

 The  noise  "gonna  go  nuts  with  distortion,  compression  and  other  vct  plugins"  John.   Both  variants  "have  the  same  amount  of  buzzing  noise"   "Instrumentals  are  very  good.  It's  holy  shit  level.  Unwa  v1e/Gabox  Fv5  are  still  amazing,  it's  
just
 
nice
 
to
 
have
 
such
 
a
 
decent
 
model
 
like
 
these
 
new
 
ones
 
on
 
a
 
different
 
arch"

 From  the  songs  I’ve  tested,  SCNet  is  incredible.  Very  full  sounding"  mrmason347   "Regular  high  fullness  though  has  a  less  full  instrumental  but  quite  good  acapella"

 VHF  leaves  some  vocal  residues  in  metal,  but  seems  to  do  well  for  e.g.  alt-pop.  "scnet  doesn't  pick  up  the  drone  backing  vocals,  but  10.2024  has  mad  violin  bleed  in  the  
vocals"

 For  "mainly  orchestral  tracks  with  choir"  "it  gave  me  noticeably  fuller  results  than  v1e"  
Shintaro5034.
 "For  noisy/dense  mixes  though,  Roformers  are  probably  better,  especially  for  inst.  scnet  seems  better  at  preserving  treble  in  some  vocals.  These  high  fullness  models  
especially
 
so.
 
So
 
maybe
 
teaming
 
SCNet
 
up
 
with
 
Roformer
 
might
 
give
 
a
 
nice
 
middle
 
ground"
 “Rofos  are  really  bad  for  some  kinds  of  EDM  that  are  very  aggressive  (Dubstep,  Trance,  
Breakcore,
 
etc...),
 
also
 
it
 
has
 
a
 
very
 
hard
 
time
 
with
 
Experimental
 
(IDM)”
 VHF  seems  to  have  more  crossbleed  in  some  songs,  along  with  also  basic  XL  model.  Some  
songs
 
which
 
sound
 
full
 
enough
 
even
 
with
 
basic
 
SCNet
 
XL.
 
While
 
others
 
sound
 
muddy
