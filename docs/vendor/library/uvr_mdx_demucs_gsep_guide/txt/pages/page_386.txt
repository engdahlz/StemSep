by
 
tsurumeso).
 For  more  information  on  VR  arch,  see  here  for  official  documentation  and  settings:  https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/tree/v5-beta-cml https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui   The  best   
VR  settings  Explained  in  detail   Settings  available  in  Colab and  in  CLI  branch,  and  also  UVR  5  GUI  (but  without  at  least  mirroring2.  mirroring  in  UVR5  GUI  for  VR  arch  got  replaced  entirely  by  High  End  Process  
(works
 
as
 
mirroring
 
now,
 
and
 
not
 
like
 
original
 
High
 
End
 
Process
 
which
 
was
 
originally
 
dedicated
 
for
 
very
 
old
 
16kHz
 
VR
 
models
 
only).
  These  VR  models  can  be  used  in  this  1)  Colab or  in  2)  UVR5  GUI or  on  3)  mvsep.com (uses  512  windows  size,  aggressiveness  option,  various  models)  4)  x-minus.pro/uvronline.app  (for  
free

   I  had  at  least  one  report  that  results  for  just  VR  models  are  better  using  Colab  above/old  CLI  
branch
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
newest
 
UVR5
 
GUI,
 
so
 
be
 
aware
