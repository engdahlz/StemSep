[page 12/642]
    Seems  to  also  have  a  lot  less  of  the  classic  MVSep  phase  issue,  where  for  some  reason  half  
the
 
stem
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
synth
 
stem
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
half
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
no
 
synth
 
stem
 
 and  inverting  it  cancels  it  out  (literally  almost  all  models  have  this  issue  on  MVSep  it's  very  
strange).
 
It's
 
much
 
less
 
than
 
the
 
other
 
models,
 
but
 
yeah,
 
it
 
still
 
happens.
 
(...)
 
Using
 
any
 
other
 
model
 
in
 
UVR
 
or
 
uvronline
 
don't
 
have
 
this
 
issue.
 
(...)
 
I
 
put
 
a
 
bass
 
guitar
 
stem
 
from
 
Fortnite
 
festival,
 
it
 
worked
 
exceptionally
 
well.
 
Not
 
much
 
muddiness
 
at
 
ALL,
 
really
 
good.
 
Separated
 
the
 
synth
 
bass
 
stem
 
from
 
bass
 
really
 
well.
 
Ok
 
wait,
 
it
 
seems
 
very
 
freaky,
 
extremely
 
freaky.
 It  has  the  phasing  issue.  Yeah,  WTF.  It  inverts”  -  Isling  “I  put  it  the  synth  model  through  a  really  packed  song  with  no  synth  to  see  if  it  would  get  
tripped
 
up,
 
it
 
didn't
 
other
 
than
 
some
 
bass
 
at
 
the
 
end.
 Which  actually  didn't  get  picked  up  by  the  bass  model,  so  even  that  is  a  win”  -  dynamic64   -  “Several  SATB  (soprano,  alto,  tenor,  bass)  choir  models  I  trained  ages  ago,  currently  only  a  
scnet_masked
 
model
 
is
 
available,
 
but
 
I
 
did
 
have
 
Demucs,
 
MDX23C,
 
and
 
standard
 
SCNet
 
models
 
that
 
I
 
will
 
upload
 
to
 
this
 
link
 
when/if
 
I
 
find
 
them,
 
although
 
I'm
 
pretty
 
sure
 
the
 
scnet_masked
 
model
 
was
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
the
 
end:

the
 
potential
 
on
 
this
 
kind
 
of
 
model
 
ngl.”

 “You  can’t  install  [the  VR  ones]  into  UVR  since  that  only  supports  VR  v5  [and  5.1]  not  VR  v6”   -  (MVSEP)  Seven  new  models  have  been  added:  1)  MVSep  Electric  Guitar  (electric-guitar,  other).  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251031064813-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 2)  MVSep  French  Horn  (french-horn,  other).

Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251031100508-f0bb276157-mixture.wav”  -  ZFTurbo   “The  Harmonica  model  is  hit  or  miss.”  -  musicbybrooks  “Wow,  the  electric  guitar  model  is  really  neat.  One  thing  I  noticed  is  that  it  seems  to  be  better  
than
 
other
 
models
 
at
 
picking
 
up
 
midi/synth
 
lead
 
guitars.
 
At
 
least
 
on
 
stuff
 
I
 
tried.
 I  think  it  also  gets  tripped  up  a  bit  more  by  weird  FX  and  synth  sounds  being  partially  flagged  
as
 
guitar.
 
An
 
interesting
 
model,
 
though,
 
for
 
sure.”
