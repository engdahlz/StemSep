    More  muddy  than  Kim  above,  a  bit  less  of  vocal  residues,  a  bit  more  artificial  sound.   -   Mel-RoFormer  Karaoke  /  Lead  vocal  isolation  model  files  released  by  Aufr33  and  viperx  (download)   
 Older  models  in  Download  Center   -  older  viperx’  1297  model  tend  to  be  a  bit  better  for  instrumentals,  and  1296  for  vocals  (both  
more
 
muddy
 
than
 
Kim
 
and
 
Unwa
 
models,
 
but
 
“still
 
pretty
 
good
 
for
 
voice
 
cleaning”
 
and
 
dealing
 
with
 
noise)
 
-
 
BS-Large
 
model
 
by
 
Unwa
 
is
 
a
 
fine-tune
 
of
 
that
 
model.
  -  1143  model  is  the  first  Mel-Roformer  trained  by  viperx  before  Kim  introduced  changes  to  
the
 
config,
 
which
 
fixed
 
the
 
problem
 
of
 
lower
 
SDR
 
vs
 
models
 
trained
 
on
 
BS-Roformer.
 
Use
 
Kim
 
Mel-Roformer
 
instead
   Both  models  struggle  with  saxophone  and  e.g.  some  Arabic  guitars.  It  can  still  depend  on  a  
song
 
whether
 
these
 
are
 
better
 
than
 
even
 
the
 
second
 
oldest
 
Roformer
 
than
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
(from
 
before
 
viperx
 
model
 
got
 
fine-tuned
 
version).
 
They
 
tend
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
problems
 
with
 
recognizing
 
instruments.
 
Other
 
than
 
that,
 
they're
 
very
 
good
 
for
 
vocals
 
(although
 
Mel-Roformer
 
by
 
Kim
 
on
 
x-minus
 
tends
 
to
 
be
 
better).
 Muddy  instrumentals  when  not  ensembled  with  other  archs.  Be  aware  that  names  of  these  models  on  UVR  refer  to  SDR  measurements  of  vocals  
conducted
 
on
 
private
 
viperx
 
dataset,
 
not
 
even
 
older
 
Synthetic
 
dataset,
 
instead
 
of
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
on
 
MVSEP,
 
hence
 
the
 
numbers
 
are
 
higher
 
than
 
in
 
the
 
multisong
 
chart
 
on
 
MVSEP.
    Infos  and  fixes  for  older  patch  #1/2   
(with
 
matching
 
overlap
 
(reversed)
 
and
 
dim_t
 
necessity)
  -  To  avoid  separation  errors  for  4GB  VRAM  and  AMD/Intel  GPUs  using  Roformers,  set  
segments
 
32,
 
overlap
 
2
 
and
 
dim_t
 
201
 
with
 
num_overlap
 
2
 
both
 
at
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
yaml
 
config
 
in
 
\models\MDX_Net_Models\model_data\mdx_c_configs
 
 (dim_t  301  and  overlap  3  also  works,  although  not  on  all  models  [e.g.  not  for  beta  3,  but  inst  
v1]
 
and
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
less
 
muddy
 
and
 
fewer
 
clicks
 
appear).
 
 dim_t  201  is  not  optimal  setting  and  might  lead  to  more  occasional  quiet  residues,  clicks  or  
sudden
 
volume
 
changes
 
(like
 
chunk
 
was
 
changing
 
every
 
2
 
seconds),
 
although
 
there’s
 
no
 
stem
 
misalignment
 
issue
 
with
 
these
 
settings
 
(they
 
work
 
both
 
for
 
Mel
 
and
 
BS
 
Roformers).
 
dim_t
 
301
 
with
 
lighter
 
models
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
bare
 
minimum
 
to
 
avoid
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
audible
 
artefacts
 
(after
 
patch
 
#3
 
dim_t
 
256
 
is
 
allowed
 
-
 
“make
 
sure
 
you
 
check
 
the
 
"Segment
 
Default"
 
in
 
MDXNET23
 
Only
 
Options
 
for
 
it
 
to
 
take
 
effect”).
