     -  Aufr33  added  MDX  HQ4  to  x-minus/uvronline  via  this  link:  https://uvronline.app/ai?hp&test-mdx  -  (x-minus/uvronline.app)  “viperx  has  updated  the  piano  model!  I  just  replaced  it  on  the  website.”  Aufr33   “The  new  piano  model  is  incredible,  I  have  even  been  able  to  separate  a  harpsichord  by  
passing
 
it
 
over
 
and
 
over
 
again
 
through
 
the
 
model
 
until
 
the
 
other
 
instruments
 
are
 
left
 
alone
 
and
 
it
 
doesn't
 
sound
 
bad
 
at
 
all.”
  There  was  some  update  to  MVSEP  piano  models  lately  too,  and  there  are  SCNet  and  viperx  
models
 
and
 
ensemble
 
with
 
metrics
 
added
 
on
 
the
 
website
 
(at
 
least
 
on
 
separate
 
page
 
beside
 
multi
 
song
 
dataset
 
chart).
  “both  similar  but  mvsep  has  a  teeny  bit  more  bleed  during  the  choruses  and  whatnot”   -  (MVSEP)  “I  added  possibility  to  use  Bas  Curtiz’  MelRoformer  model  with  large  score  on  
Synth
 
dataset.
 
You
 
must
 
choose
 
it
 
from
 
MelRoformer
 
options.
 
By
 
default,
 
my
 
model
 
is
 
used.
 The  problem  with  Bas's  model  is  that  it's  very  heavy  and  slow,  with  almost  the  same  score  
on
 
Multi
 
dataset.”

  “I've  tried  some  songs  and  have  great  result!  Music  sounds  fuller  than  original  Kim's  one  &  
the
 
finetuned
 
version
 
from
 
ZFTurbo.
 
Even
 
[though]
 
the
 
SDR
 
is
 
smaller
 
than
 
BS
 
Roformer
 
finetuned
 
last
 
version,
 
but
 
almost
 
song
 
has
 
the
 
best
 
result
 
in
 
instrumental.
 
  1  song  I  found  is  bad  result  is  from  Wham  -  Where  did  your  hearts  go.  The  trumpet  or  sax  
whatever
 
sound
 
was
 
lost,
 
the
 
model
 
detects
 
it
 
as
 
vocal,
 
and
 
the
 
1st
 
beginning
 
of
 
vocal
 
still
 
heard.
 
On
 
other
 
mel
 
roformer,
 
that
 
trumpet
 
or
 
sax
 
sound
 
can
 
still
 
separate
 
it
 
as
 
well.”

  -  (MVSEP)  “Guitar  model  was  updated.  I  added  BSRoformer  model  by  viperx  with  SDR:  
7.16.
 
And
  -  I  replaced  [guitar]  Ensemble.  Earlier  it  was  MDX23C  +  Mel.  Now  its  BS  +  Mel.  SDR  
increased
 
from
 
7.18
 
to
 
7.51.
