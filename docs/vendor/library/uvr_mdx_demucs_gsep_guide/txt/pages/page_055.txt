    It’s  a  diffusion  distillation  of  AudioSR,  and  has  lower  Aura  MR  STFT  metric,  and  usually  lower  quality  as  well,  but  it  might  give  better  results  for  music  for  some  people   -  (MVSEP)  “We  trained  new  DrumSep  models  (5  stem  and  6  stem)  based  on  SCNet  XL.  *  5  stems:  cymbals,  hh,  kick,  snare,  toms  *  6  stems:  ride,  crash,  hh,  kick,  snare,  toms”  Both  have  better  SDR  than  the  previous  MDX23C  model  by  jarredou  and  Aufr33.  The  5  stems  variant  has  e.g.  better  snare  SDR  than  the  6  stems  variant.  Full  metrics.  It  doesn't  work  correctly  on  the  site  yet,  it  will  be  announced  in  the  link  above  by  ZFTurbo  
when
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
fixed.

there's
 
still
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
noise
 
presence
 
than
 
v1e.
 In  terms  of  fullness  though,  for  some  reason  it  sounds  as  if  it's  actually  less  full  than  v1e,  
despite
 
the
 
higher
 
instrumental
 
fullness
 
SDR.
 Despite  v4's  significant  amount  of  noise,  it  seems  to  be  the  only  model  that  gave  me  a  fuller  
sounding
 
result
 
compared
 
to
 
v1e
 
that's
 
actually
 
perceivable
 
by
 
my

  -  New  inst/voc  SYH99999  models  released  https://huggingface.co/SYH99999/MelBandRoformerSYHFTB1/tree/main  -  (x-minus)  Phase  fixer  added  for  Gabox  fv3  and  becruily  models  for  premium  users   -  For  vocals,  you  can  alleviate  some  of  the  noise/residues  in  unwa’s  5e  model  by  using  
phase
 
fixer/swapper
 
and
 
using
 
becruily
 
vocals
 
model
 
as
 
a
 
reference
 
(imogen).
  -  For  instrumentals,  you  can  try  unwa's  v1e  with  phase  swap  at  500/500  with  original  mel  
band
 
of
 
kim.
 
It
 
consistently
 
gives
 
less
 
noise

  "500  /  500  means  you  use  original  phase  below  500  Hz  and  hard  cutoff/swap  to  transferred  
phase
 
above
 
500hz.
 
(this
 
can
 
potentially
 
create
 
phase
 
artifacts
 
at
 
500Hz
 
because
 
of
 
hard
 
swap)
  500  /  20000  means  you  use  original  phase  below  500hz  and  progressively  crossfade  to  
transferred
 
phase
 
until
 
20000hz
 
and
 
transferred
 
phase
 
is
 
used
 
above
 
20000hz.
 
So
 
it's
 
softer
 
phase
 
swap
 
below
 
20kHz"
