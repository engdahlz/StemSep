    “great  model  (at  least  for  K-pop  it  achieved  the  clarity  and  quality  that  no  other  model  
managed
 
to
 
have)
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
noted
 
that
 
it
 
has
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
noise
 
even
 
in
 
its
 
latest
 
update,
 
its
 
stability
 
is
 
impressive,
 
how
 
it
 
captures
 
vocal
 
chops,
 
in
 
blank
 
spaces
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
leave
 
a
 
vocal
 
record,
 
sometimes
 
the
 
voice
 
on
 
certain
 
occasions
 
tries
 
to
 
eliminate
 
them
 
confusing
 
them
 
with
 
noise,
 
but
 
in
 
general
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
model
 
that
 
impressed
 
me.
 
It
 
captures
 
the
 
instruments
 
very
 
clearly”

 “NOISY  AF,  this  is  probably  the  dumbest  idea  ever  had  for  an  instrumental  model.  Don’t  use  
it
 
as
 
your
 
main
 
one,
 
some
 
vocals
 
will
 
leak
 
because
 
I
 
added
 
tracks
 
with
 
vocal
 
chops
 
to
 
the
 
dataset.
 
Just
 
use
 
this
 
model
 
for
 
songs
 
that
 
have
 
vocal
 
chops”

To
 
alleviate
 
it,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
with
 automated  phase  fixer  Colab or  UVR>Tools  (Kim  Mel  as  reference  removes  more  noise  than  2024.10  vs  muddier  Unwa  v1/2  on  their  own;  optionally  use  VOCALS-MelBand-Roformer  by

you

it
 
“cuts

vs

which
 
can

rather
 
better
 
alternative).
 
Optionally,
 
in

Fixer
 
you
 
can
 
set
 
420
 
for
 
low
 and  4200  for  high  or  500  for  both  and  Mel-Kim  model  for  source;  and  bleed  suppressor (by  unwa/97chris)  to  alleviate  the  noise  further  (e.g.  phase  fixer  on  its  own  works  better  with  v1  
model
 
to
 
alleviate
 
the
 
residues).
 
Besides
 
the
 
default
 
UVR
 
default
 
500/5000
 
and
 
Colab
 
default
 
500/9000
 
values,
 
you
 
could
 
potentially
 
“even
 
try
 
like
 
200/1000
 
or
 
even
 
below
 
for
 
2nd
 
value.”
  
“I
 
would
 
say
 
that
 
the
 
more
 
noisy
 
the
 
input
 
is,
 
the
 
lower
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
set
 
the
 
frequency
 
for
 
the
 
phase
 
fixer.”
  V1e  might  catch  more  instruments  and  vocals  than  INSTV6N.  Even  fuller  model  with  more  
noise
 
is

 “The  "e"  stands  for  emphasis,  indicating  that  this  is  a  model  that  emphasizes  fullness.”  “However,  compared  to  v1,  while  the  fullness score  has  increased,  there  is  a  possibility  that  noise  has  also  increased.”  “lighter  compared  to  v2.”  Like  other  unwa’s  models,  it  can  
struggle
 
with
 
flute,
 
sax
 
and
 
trumpet
 
(unlike
 
Mel
 
2024.10,
 
and

you
 
can

Also,
 
sometimes

Like
 
v1e
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
fullness,
 
but
 
less
 
bleeding.
 Vs  v1e  “it's  slightly  better  with  some  instruments”,  It  might  pick  up  an  entire  sax  in  the  vocal  
stem.
