    want  to  use  CPU  processing  instead,  then  min.  8GB  RAM  recommended).  We’re  talking  
about
 
the
 
newer
 
Batchmode
 
(you
 
cannot
 
choose
 
Chunk
 
mode
 
anymore
 
in
 
newer
 
versions).
  -  (no  longer  needed)  4GB  VRAM  cards  should  be  supported  out  of  the  box  with  chunks  set  
to
 
auto
 
(6GB
 
may
 
be
 
required
 
for
 
longer
 
tracks
 
for
 
auto
 
setting
 
or
 
batch
 
processing
 
for
 
chunks
 
higher
 
than
 
at
 
least
 
10).
  (probably  fixed)  4GB  GPUs  will  sometimes  force  you  to  reopen  UVR  after  each  separation  to  
free
 
up
 
VRAM
 
or
 
else
 
separation
 
might
 
be
 
unsuccessful
 
(setting
 
chunks
 
in
 
old
 
versions
 
of
 
UVR
 
to
 
10
 
or
 
lower
 
might
 
alleviate
 
the
 
issue).
 
  -  UVR5  GUI  instead  of  old  CML  “mirroring”  has  now  “hi-end  process”  for  VR  models  which  is  
actual
 
mirroring
 
(no
 
mirroring2,
 
not
 
sure
 
about
 
possible
 
automatic
 
bypass
 
from
 
CML
 
while
 
using
 
ensemble
 
of
 
VR
 
models)
 
but
 
don’t
 
confuse
 
it
 
with
 
old
 
“hi-end
 
process”
 
from
 
CML
 
version
 
which
 
was
 
dedicated
 
for
 
16kHz
 
models.
  Q:  If  you  run  a  single  model  with  default  configuration,  it  is  okay  with  success.  The  problem  
is
 
when
 
ensemble
 
2
 
models,
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
enough
 
resources
 
to
 
complete
 
the
 
process.
 
Unless
 
using
 
a
 
manual
 
ensemble.
 
It
 
also
 
has
 
an
 
error
 
if
 
the
 
chunk
 
size
 
was
 
changed,
 
even
 
with
 
a
 
single
 
model.
 
Seems
 
there
 
is
 
not
 
enough
 
VRAM
 
for
 
processing
 
the
 
song.
  A:  I  had  the  same  issue  the  other  day  running  ensemble  4  models.  Turned  out  -  as  the  error  msg  showed,  the  chunk  size  was  too  big...  I  prolly  must  have  changed  it  by  accident  to  `Full`  -  when  I  set  it  back  to  `Auto`  -  it  was  able  
to
 
process.
 U  can  find  this  setting  under  Settings  >  Advanced  MDX  Options.   -  (probably  fixed)  For  4GB  VRAM  GPU  and  VR  3090  models  (e  g.  1,2,9_HP-UVR)  you  may  
need
 
to
 
split
 
e.g.
 
2:34
 
song
 
into
 
two
 
parts
 
(I
 
recommend
 
lossless-cut)
 
or
 
eventually
 
use
 
chunks
 
option
 
if
 
you
 
encounter
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
memory
 
CUDA
 
error.
 
Lossless-cut
 
will
 
do
 
chunking,
 
so
 
it
 
won’t
 
be
 
necessary
 
to
 
set
 
chunks
 
in
 
UVR
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
some
 
problems
 
(not
 
in
 
all
 
cases
 
on
 
4GB
 
VRAM).
  -  (fixed  in  the  latest  Roformer  patch  iirc)   "When  choosing  to  save  either  vocals  or  
instrumentals
 
only,
 
the
 
app
 
saves
 
the
 
exact
 
opposite
 
(if
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
save
 
vocals
 
only,
 
it
 
will
 
save
 
instrumental,
 
and
 
vice
 
versa)"
  -   A  value  of  10  for  aggressiveness  in  VR  models  is  equivalent  to  0.1  (10/100=0.1)  in  Colab   -   Hidden  feature  of  the  GUI:  "All  the  old  v5  beta  models  that  weren't  part  of  the  main  package  are  compatible  as  well.  
Only
 
thing
 
is,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
append
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
parameter
 
to
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
model
 
name"
 Also,  V4  models  are  compatible  using  this  method.
