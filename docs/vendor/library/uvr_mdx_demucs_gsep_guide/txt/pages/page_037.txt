[page 37/642]
    Some  crossbleeding  issues  from  v10  are  still  present,  plus  some  songs  are  even  getting  
worse
 
results
 
than
 
in
 
v10.
 
You
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
v1e
 
(with
 
phase
 
fix)
 
+
 
Becruily
 
vocal
 
model
 
(Max
 
Spec)
 
instead,
 
although
 
some
 
people
 
might
 
still
 
like
 
Dango
 
anyway.
 
 “Some  tracks  are  fuller  than  Gabox  v8”.  Conservative  mode  is  less  full  than  V1e.  “They  have  a  tool  called  "edit  &  improve"  [or  “Advanced  Repair  tool”]  that  lets  you  use  
'Conservative
 
mode'
 
for
 
some
 
of
 
more
 
complex
 
parts
 
of
 
a
 
song
 
and
 
'Smart
 
mode'
 
for
 
other
 
parts.
 
I
 
find
 
that
 
way
 
more
 
convenient
 
than
 
processing
 
the
 
entire
 
track
 
in
 
'Conservative'
 
mode.”
 They  plan  to  release  a  karaoke  model  in  two  months.   -  Gabox  released  a  “small”  version  of  Mel  instrumental  model  for  faster  inference  |  yaml Be  aware  that  it  can  have  some  audible  faint  constant  residues.   -  ZFTurbo:  “I  added  BS  Roformer  SW  to  "MVSep  Piano",   "MVSep  Guitar",   "MVSep  Bass",   
"MVSep
 
Drums"
 
algorithms.
 
For
 
Bass
 
and
 
Drums
 
available
 
new
 
Ensembles.”
 “drum  SDR  jumped  by  .6  on  the  ensemble!  Atho  fullness  took  a  hit”  -  heuhew  “Same  with  bass,  sdr  leaped  but  fullness  shot  down  4  points”  -  dynamic64   -  BS-Roformer  SW  6  stem  model  replaced  the  old  one.  
Iirc,
 
the
 
model
 
didn’t
 
change,
 
just
 
the
 
inference
 
code.
 
SW
 
stands
 
for
 
“shared
 
weights”
 “I  got  better  drums/bass  separation  with  that  model  than  with  any  others  when  input  is  some  
live/rehearsal
 
recordings
 
with
 
shitty
 
sound”
 Also,  there’s  better  SDR  and  fullness  for  instrumentals  when  you  invert  vocals  against  
mixture
 
instead
 
of
 
mixing
 
down
 
drums/bass/other
 
stems.
  -  undef13  released  these  “bs-roformer  weights  stored  in  fp16  precision,  half  the  size  of  
frazer's
 
initial
 
version.
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
exact
 
same
 
as
 
the
 
fp32
 
version”.
  -  First  vocal  retrain  was  published  shortly  after  a  day  “May  not  perform  very  well”  (at  least  for  
now)
 If  you  were  to  fine-tune  it  “this  model  generalizes  like  crazy  (...)  hasn't  failed  yet  to  confuse  
instruments
 
and
 
just
 
chews
 
through
 
whatever
 
you
 
put
 
through
 
it
 
(i
 
ignore
 
the
 
overall
 
mudiness)”
 
you
 
can
 
retrain
 
it
 
to
 
just
 
being
 
inst/voc
 
model
 
“I’m
 
currently
 
training
 
it
 
to
 
my
 
2
 
stem
 
(...)
 
dataset
 
(...)
 
I
 
was
 
pleasantly
 
surprised)”
 
iirc
 
on
 
even
 
laptop
 
RTX
 
3070...
  -  Added  on  MVSEP  as  BS-Roformer  6  stem  (no  clicking  issues)   -  The  new  Logic  Pro  model  has  been  reversed/cracked  and  shared  as  a  standalone  model  
for
 
inference.
 
Full
 
metrics
 
for
 
all
 
stems
 
added
 
later
 
below.
 
It
 
has
 
the
 
best
 
SDR
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
for
 
all
 
stems
 
besides
 
vocals
 
(but
 
still
 
not
 
bad).
 
It
 
uses
 
a
 
BS-Reformer
 
arch.
 
.MIL
 
(CoreML)
 
model
 
file
 
was
 
converted
 
to
 
.PT.
 
 “The  only  change  they  made  was  a  global  parameter  for  bias  which  I've  never  seen  before  
so
 
I
 
guess
 
it's
 
apple
 
secret
 
sauce”.
 
No
 
quantization
 
was
 
used
 
“they
 
had
 
a
 
shared
 
bias
 
across
 
QKV
 
and
 
the
 
out_proj”.
