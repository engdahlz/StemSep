Be

happened
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
that
 
along
 
years,
 
among
 
very
 
big
 
collection
 
of
 
files,
 
someone
 
had
 
I
 
think
 
some
 
even
 
encrypted
 
private
 
files
 
deleted,
 
but
 
usually
 
only
 
DCMAed
 
files
 
are
 
taken
 
out.
 
Since
 
around
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2023,
 
they
 
started
 
sending
 
PMs
 
to
 
users
 
warning
 
about
 
deleting
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
files
 
on
 
their
 
account,
 
moving
 
them
 
to
 
special
 
folders
 
with
 
deletion
 
date.
 
You
 
can
 
reupload
 
your
 
file
 
after
 
deletion
 
date
 
again.
 
The
 
same
 
action
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
repeated
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
a
 
year.
 Also,  the  site  exists  since  “forever”  (2006),  and  didn't  collapse  despite  many  court  cases,  
probably
 
due
 
to
 
creative
 
changes
 
of
 
owners
 
from
 
specific
 
countries.
 
It
 
can
 
be
 
also
 
used
 
as
 
public
 
sharing
 
disk
 
with
 
points
 
of
 
transfer
 
for
 
downloaded
 
content
 
from
 
your
 
disk.

 Some  files  uploaded  on  Pixeldrain  are  only  available  for  Pro  users.   
On
 
some
 
files
 
it
 
will
 
just
 
tell
 
you
 
that

the

will
 
last

So
 
I'd
 
rather
 
refrain
 
from
 
using
 
it.
 
I
 
think
 
I
 
confused
 
it
 
with
 
an
 
issue
 
with
 
gofile
 
I
 
once
 
had.
