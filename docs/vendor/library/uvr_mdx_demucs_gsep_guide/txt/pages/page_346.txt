    you  lack  space  on  C:  drive,  create  your  folders  using  Symlink  Creator to  redirect  the  content  to  some  other  disk,  keeping  the  C:\  location  in  the  Windows  file  system  logic.  Or  else,  copying  only  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\gui_data  folder  to  the  C:\  drive  while  keeping  
the
 
GUI
 
installation
 
on
 
another
 
drive
 
might
 
work
 
as
 
well.

  -  There’s  no  way  to  bypass  the  3  GB  free  disk  space  requirement  on  C:  drive,  even  for  using  AudioTools.  Here someone  set  UVR  to  L:  drive,  and  it  read  free  space  from  that  letter,  but  I’m  not  sure  if  they  just  installed  UVR  in  that  location,  and  whether  it’s  still  possible  using  the  
latest
 
UVR
 
versions
 
(even
 
when
 
UVR
 
was
 
uninstalled
 
previously)
 
or
 
whether
 
it’s
 
enough
 
to
 
copy
 
UVR
 
elsewhere
 
and/or
 
change
 
something
 
in
 
the
 
registry
 
about

path.
  -   UVR  GUI  will  only  process  files  with  English  characters  (might  be  fixed,  although  some  
complicated
 
names/paths
 
still
 
give
 
“System
 
error”
 
during
 
separation)

  -  The  provided  directory  is  not  writable  or  read  only  Run  UVR  as  admin,  or  potentially  changing  privileges  to  the  output/input  folders  to  everyone  might  help  too  (alternatively  use  “Context  Menu”  for  it  described  here)   Q:  Why  Vocal  Dereverb  Options  are  greyed  out.  I  can't  select  more,  only  "main  vocals"  A:  This  option  removes  reverb  from  a  vocal  stem.  You  must  have  the  "UVR-DeEcho-DeReverb"  VR  Arch  model  installed  to  use  this  option.   -  Matchering  doesn’t  work  correctly  with  Opus  files  (error  occurs)
