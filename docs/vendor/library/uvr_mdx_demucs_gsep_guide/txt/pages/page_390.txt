    generally  more  spoiled  other  instruments  in  comparison  to  those  above,  it  depends  on  a  
track.
 
In
 
some
 
cases
 
it
 
bleeds
 
vocal
 
less
 
than
 
HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m
  Window  size:  272  Aggressiveness:  0.3-0.32  (30-32  in  GUI)  TTA:  ON  Postprocess:  (turned  ON  in  most  cases  with  exceptions  (it’s  polishing  high-end),  and  the  
problem
 
with
 
muffling
 
instruments
 
using
 
ppr
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
exist
 
in
 
this
 
model)
 Mirroring2  (I  find  mirroring[1]  too  aggressive  for  this  model,  but  with  exceptions)   !  Be  aware  these  settings  are  very  slow  (40  minutes  per  track  in  Colab  on  the  former  default  
K80
 
GPU,
 
but
 
it's
 
faster
 
now)
 
so
 
just
 
in
 
case,
 
you
 
might
 
want
 
to
 
experiment
 
with
 
320/384,
 
or
 
at
 
worse
 
even
 
512
 
window
 
size
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
increase
 
processing
 
speed
 
in
 
cost
 
of
 
isolation
 
precision.
 Colab’s  former  default  Tesla  K80  processes  slower  than  even  GTX  1050  Ti,  so  if  you  have  a  
decent
 
Nvidia
 
GPU,
 
consider
 
using
 
UVR
 
locally.
 
Since
 
May
 
2022
 
there
 
is
 
faster
 
Tesla
 
T4
 
available
 
as
 
default,
 
so
 
there
 
shouldn't
 
be
 
any
 
problem.
  HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_2  (8_HP2-UVR)   was  worse  in  I  think  every  case  I  tested,  but  it’s  good  for  a  pair  for  ensemble  (more  about  
ensemble
 
in
 
section
 
below).
  Model:  HP2-MAIN-MSB2-3BAND-3090_arch-500m  (7_HP2-UVR.pth)   4)  Last  resort,  e.g.  when  you  have  a  lot  of  artifacts  (heavily  filtered  vocal  residues)  some  
instruments
 
spoiled,
 
and
 
no
 
equal
 
sound
 
across
 
the
 
track.
 
Last
 
resort,
 
because
 
it’s
 
3
 
band,
 
instead
 
of
 
4
 
band,
 
and
 
it
 
lacks
 
some
 
hi-end/clarity,
 
but
 
if
 
your
 
track
 
is
 
very
 
demanding
 
to
 
filter
 
out
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
then
 
it’s
 
good
 
choice.
 
The
 
best
 
SDR
 
among
 
VR-arch
 
models.
  Window  size:  272  Aggressiveness:  0.3  TTA:  ON  Postprocess:  ON  Mirroring   It’s  similarly  nightmarishly  slow  in  Colab  just  like  500m_1/2  using  these  settings  (1  hour  for  a  
track
 
on
 
K80)
 
when
 
you
 
got
 
accidentally
 
slower
 
Tesla
 
K80
 
assigned
 
in
 
Colab
 
instead
 
of
 
Tesla
 
T4.
  HighPrecison_4band_arch-124m_1   *)  May  sometimes  harm  instruments  less  than  HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m,  but  may  leak  
vocals
 
more
 
in
 
many
 
cases,
 
but
 
generally
 
instrumentals
 
lacks
 
some
 
clarity,
 
but
 
it
 
sounds
