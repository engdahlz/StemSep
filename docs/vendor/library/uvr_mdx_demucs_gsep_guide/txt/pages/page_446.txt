    It  normalizes  the  input,  so  you  cannot  use  Bas’  trick  to  decrease  volume  by  -3dB  to  
workaround
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
bleeding
 
like
 
in
 
Ripple
 
(unless
 
you
 
trick
 
out
 
the
 
CapCut,
 
possibly
 
by
 
adding
 
some
 
loud
 
sound
 
in
 
the
 
song
 
with
 
decreased
 
volume).
  “At  the  moment  the  separation  is  only  available  in  Chinese  version  of  Windows  app  which  is  
jianyingpro,
 
download
 
available
 
at
 
capcut.cn
 
[probably
 
here
 
-
 
it’s
 
where
 
you’re
 
redirected
 
after
 
you
 
click
 
“Alternate
 
download
 
link”
 
on
 
the
 
main
 
page,
 
where
 
download
 
might
 
not
 
work
 
at
 
all]
  Some  people  cannot  find  the  settings  on  this screen  in  order  to  separate.  Separation  doesn't  require  sign  up/login,  but  exporting  does,  and  requires  VIP,  which  is  paid  
depending
 
on
 
whether
 
you’re
 
from
 
rich
 
or
 
poor
 
country,
 
then
 
it’s
 
free.
  -  There’s  a  workaround  for  people  not  able  to  split  using  Capcut  for  Windows  in  various  
regions.
 
  -  Bas  Curtiz'  new  video  on  how  to  install  and  use  Capcut  for  separation  incl.  exporting:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppfyl91bJIw  "It's  a  bit  of  a  hassle  to  set  it  up,  but  do  realize:  -  This  is  the  only  way  (besides  Ripple  on  iOS)  to  run  ByteDance's  model  (best  based  on  
SDR).
 -  Only  the  Chinese  version  has  these  VIP  features;  now  u  will  have  it  in  English  -  Exporting  is  a  paid  feature  (normally);  now  u  get  it  for  free   The  instructions  displayed  in  the  video  are  also  in  the  YouTube  description."   -  mitmproxy  script allowing  to  save  to  FLAC  instead  of  AAC  (although  it  just  reencodes  from  AAC  113kbps  with  15.6kHz  lowpass  filter).  It’s  a  bit  more  than  script.  See  the  full tutorial.   -  For  some  people  using  mitmproxy  scripts  for  Capcut  (but  not  everyone),  they  “changed  
their
 
security
 
to
 
reject
 
all
 
incoming
 
packet
 
which
 
was
 
run
 
through
 
mitmproxy.
 
I
 
saw
 
the
 
mitmproxy
 
log
 
said
 
the

for
 
TLS
 
not
 
allowed
 
to

their
 
API.
 
And
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
errors
 
on
 
mitmproxy
 
such
 
as

 “At  60%  it  looks  like  the  progress  isn't  going  up,  but  give  it  idk,  1  min  tops,  and  it  splits  fine.”  -
