     KAN-Stem  That  might  be  interesting  to  train  multistem,  it’s  based  on  Demucs:  https://github.com/waefrebeorn/KAN-Stem   VR  architecture  by  tsurumeso  https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover (VR  models  in  UVR,  use  modified  v5  training  code  in  order  to  support  e.g.  4  bands,

  The  arch  is  obsolete  for  instrumentals  -  bleeding  and  vocal  artefacts.  Not  really  recommended  anymore,  unless  for  specific  tasks  like  de-noise,  de-reverb  or

 -  For  high-resolution  audio  sources,  the  samples  are  reduced  to  44.1kHz  during  conversion.  -  If  possible,  match  the  playback  position  and  volume  of  the  OnVocal  and  OffVocal  sound
