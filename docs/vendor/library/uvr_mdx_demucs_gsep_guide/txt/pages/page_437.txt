     Afterwards,  click  on  the  play  button  to  start  the  separation,  **make  sure**  you  uploaded  the  
audio
 
file
 
in
 
the
 
`folder_path`
 
you
 
provided.
 After  it's  done,  it  will  output  the  stems  in  the  `output_folder`.   Also  note,  "`filename_instrum`"  is  the  inversion  of  the  separated  vocals  stems  against  the  
original
 
audio.
  "`filename_instrum2`"  is  the  sum  of  the  Drums  +  Bass  +  Other  stems  that  are  obtained  by  
processing
 
"`instrum`"
 
with
 
multiple
 
Demucs
 
models.
  So  "`instrum`"  is  the  most  untouched  and  "`instrum2`"  can  have  fewer  vocals  residues.    Installing  the  Colab  locally  NVIDIA  12GB  VRAM  GPU  recommended   "I  think  it's  possible  to  use  Colab  notebook  .ipynb  files  locally  with  anaconda  and  jupyter,  but
