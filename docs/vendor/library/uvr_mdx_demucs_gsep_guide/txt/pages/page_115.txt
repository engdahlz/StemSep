 -  1053  model  separates  drums  and  bass  in  one  stem,  and  it's  very  good  at  it  (although  now  it  might  be  better  to  use  Mel-Roformer  drums  on  x-minus.pro/uvronline)  “Target  is  drums  and  bass,  and  "other"  is  the  rest.  Despite  that,  it  says  vocals”   -  Unwa  released  a  new  Inst  v1e  model |  Colab |  MSST-GUI (“The  model  [yaml]  configuration  is  the  same  as  v1”)

 becruily  released  a  Python  script fixing  the  noise  issue  (execute  “pip  install  librosa”  in  case  of  module  not  found  error)  -  it  sound  similar  to  the  method  used  for  premium  user  on  x-minus.   -  unwa  beta  4  Mel-Roformer  (fine  tune  of  Kim’s  voc/inst  model  ):  https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-big/tree/main |  Colab Be  aware  that  the  yaml  config  has  changed,  and  you  need  to  download  the  new  beta4  yaml.  “Metrics  on  my  test  dataset  have  improved  over  beta3,  but  are  probably  not  accurate  due  to
