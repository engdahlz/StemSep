  It  seems  demudder  shouldn't  be  used  when  Lead  vocal  panning  is  set  to  something  different  
than
 
center,
 
I
 
noticed
 
it
 
brings
 
back
 
the
 
lead
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
inst

it
 
was

  -  Mel-Roformer  Karaoke  (by  aufr33  &  viperx)  on  x-minus.pro /  uvronline.app /  mvsep model  file (UVR  instruction)  -  online  version  above  might  work  better,  not  sure  about  preprocessor  model,  maybe  even  old  voc_ft,  but  not  necessarily.  This  Mel  may  extract  more  than  BVE  V2 ,  if  "extract  directly  from  mixture"  on  MVSEP  doesn’t  
detect
 
the
 
BVs
 
(x-minus
 
behavior
 
for
 
this
 
model),
 
the
 
chances
 
are
 
"extract
 
from
 
vocals
 
part"
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
(which
 
uses
 
BS-Roformer
 
2024.08
 
for
 
it)
 
will
 
detect
 
more
 
BVs
 
(although
 
with
 
possible
 
cross
 
bleed
 
between
 
lead/back
 
in

  "You  can  do  it  via:  Choose  Process  Method  -->  Audio  Tools  -->  Manual  Ensemble  -->  Max  Spec  Q:  How  do  you  select  both  inputs?  A:  Via  Select  Input,  but  if  you  want  to  batch  process  Manual  Ensemble  it's  not  possible  yet"  
(dca100fb8)
  Ensemble  algorithms  like  ~“min_spec  in  the  direct  ensemble  are  only  available  if  the  
selected
 
type
 
of
 
stems
 
in
 
the
 
yaml
 
corresponds
 
with
 
the
 
target
 
in
 
UVR.
 
 Example:  If  the  target  in  the  yaml  is:    -vocals    -other  then  you  can't  use  it  in  the  Vocal/Instrumental  selection  because  it's  not  written  that  way  in  
the
 
yaml.”
