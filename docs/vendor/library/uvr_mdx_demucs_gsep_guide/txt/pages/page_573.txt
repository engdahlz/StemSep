    In  times  of  Demucs  3  there  was  also  e.g.  custom  UVR  instrumental  model  trained,  but  it  
didn’t
 
achieve
 
that
 
good
 
results
 
vs
 
MDX-UVR
 
instrumental
 
models.
  Once  there  was  UVR  Demucs  4  model  coming  up,  but  the  training  was  cancelled  due  to  
technical
 
difficulties.
 
Looks
 
like
 
ZFTurbo
 
managed
 
to
 
train
 
his
 
model
 
for
 
SDX23
 
challenge
 
and
 
also
 
vocal
 
model,
 
but
 
“[the]
 
problem
 
is
 
that
 
Demucs4
 
HT
 
[traning
 
is]
 
very
 
slow.
 
I
 
think
 
there
 
is
 
some
 
bug.
 
Bug
 
because
 
sometimes
 
I
 
observe
 
large
 
slow-downs
 
on
 
inference
 
too.
 
And
 
I
 
see
 
high
 
memory
 
bandwidth
 
-
 
something
 
is
 
copying
 
without
 
reason...”
  Spleeter  might  seem  to  be  a  good  choice,  because  training  is  pretty  well  documented,  but  it  
isn’t
 
worth
 
it
 
seeing
 
how
 
these
 
models
 
sound
 
(also
 
it
 
was
 
very
 
first
 
AI
 
for
 
audio
 
separation
 
at
 
the
 
time,
 
and
 
even
 
VR
 
arch
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
Spleeter
 
hence
 
UVR
 
team
 
started
 
to
 
train
 
on
 
VR
 
arch
 
with
 
much
 
greater
 
results
 
than
 
Spleeter).
  Your  starting  point  to  train  MDX  model  would  be  here:   https://github.com/KimberleyJensen/mdx-net (visit  this  repo,  it  has  some  instructions  and  explanations)   ZFTurbo  released  his  training  code  for  other  various  archs  here:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training  "It  gives  the  ability  to  train  5  types  of  models:  mdx23c,  htdemucs,  vitlarge23,  bs_roformer  
and
 
mel_band_roformer.
 I  also  put  some  weights  there  to  not  start  training  from  the  beginning."   “Set  up  on  Colab  is  simple:   You  only  have  to  create  one  cell  for  installation  with:   from  google.colab  import  drive  drive.mount('/content/drive')  %cd  /content/drive/MyDrive  !git  clone  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training  %cd  /content/drive/MyDrive/Music-Source-Separation-Training  !pip  install  -r  requirements.txt    And  a  cell  to  run  training:   %cd  /content/drive/MyDrive/Music-Source-Separation-Training  !python  train.py  \      --model_type  mdx23c  \      --config_path  'configs/config_vocals_mdx23c.yaml'  \      --results_path  results/  \
