     Only  problem  is  all  of  them  are  exported  in  mp3  with  a  cutoff  of  16khz,  so  it  is  equivalent  128  
kbps,
 
and
 
the
 
denoising
 
that
 
was
 
done
 
in
 
post
 
is
 
pretty
 
lazy.
 However,  I  think  if  these  parts  are  upscaled  with  FlashSR  it  would  be  great.  Or  maybe  Re-Amp  a  low  pass  filter  version  of  the  stems  with  the  Ampltibe  5  presets  that  he  
also
 
attaches
 
to
 
all
 
tabs,
 
and
 
ensemble
 
the
 
remaining
 
frequencies
 
that
 
way.
  I  personally  would  not  recommend  using  the  drum  and  bass  stems,  only  the  guitar  parts,  
since
 
the
 
drum
 
and
 
bass
 
are
 
both
 
programmed
 
and
 
are
 
uniform.
 The  tone  for  every  video  is  unique  and  tone  matched  to  their  respective  albums  and  tracks.  
Even
 
if
 
it's
 
not
 
dead
 
on,
 
it's
 
better
 
than
 
trying
 
to
 
use
 
some
 
yayhoos
 
guitar
 
doodles
 
that
 
uses
 
the
 
same
 
amp/cabinet/simulator
 
for
 
every
 
track.”

 A  lot  of  the  instrumentals  are  official  instrumental  versions  of  albums  the  stuff  with  my  username  is  from  my  stempacks  except  for  Omega  Virus,  Behold  the  Void
