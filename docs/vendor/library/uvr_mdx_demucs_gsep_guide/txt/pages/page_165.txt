    And  because  Fv8  can  be  so  clean  at  times,  the  leakage  can  be  fairly  obvious.  For  now,  my  
vote
 
is
 
for
 
Fv8,
 
but
 
I'll
 
still
 
probably
 
be
 
switching
 
back

forth
 
a

 ”Seems  to  pick  up  some  instruments  better”  Gabox.   -  Gabox  Inst_FV8b (yaml)  Inst.  fullness:  35.05,  bleedless:  36.90,  SDR  16.59.  Muddier  than  V1e+,  but  cleaner.  Some  people  might  prefer  it  over  INSTV7.  “Preserves  its  volume  stability  to  the  original  sound  of  the  songs,  it  does  not  go  down  or  lose  
strength,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
most

Alone,  it’s  as  clean  as  unwa’s  v1,  but  has  less  noise,  and  it  can  also  be  got  rid  well  by:  *)  Mel  denoise and/or  Roformer  bleed  suppressor by  unwa/97chris.  That  model  “removed  some  of  the  faint  vocals  that  even  the  bleed  suppressor  didn't  manage  to  filter  out”  before”.  
Doesn’t
 
require

fix.
 
Try
 
out
 
denoising
 
on
 
a
 
mixture
 
first,
 
then
 
use
 
the
 
model.
 On  its  own,  the  inst  model  correctly  removes  SFX  voices.  The  instrumental  model  pulled  out  
more
 
adlibs
 
than
 
the
 
released
 
vocal

variant,
 
when
 
it
 
can
 
pull

nothing.

 -  If  you  use  lower  dim_t like  256  (or  maybe  also  corresponding  chunk_size)  on  weaker  GPUs,  these  are  the  first  Mel  inst  models  to  have  muddy  results  with  it.  -  In  the  phase  fixer  you  can  experiment  with  “using  becruily's  vocals  as  source  and  inst  as

you
 can  do  it  automatically  after  separation  in  this  Colab (santilli_  suggestion).  Using  Kim  Mel  FT2  as  source  instead  might  be  more  problematic  as  it  tends  to  be  more
