    "Mirroring"  (Hi-end  process  in  GUI)  (rarely  "Mirroring2"  here,  since  the  model  itself  is  less  
smooth
 
and
 
usually
 
have
 
better
 
drums,
 
but
 
it
 
sometimes
 
leads
 
to
 
overkill
 
-
 
in
 
that
 
case
 
check
 
mirroring2
 
in
 
CLI
 
or
 
V2
 
model
 
above)
  Better  yet,  to  increase  the  quality  of  the  separation  (when  drums  in  e.g.  hip-hop  can  be  
frequently
 
damaged
 
too
 
much
 
during
 
the
 
process)
 
go
 
now
 
straight
 
to
 
the
 
Demucs
 
section
 
and
 
read
 
the
 
"Anjok's
 
tip".
  If  you  have  too  many  vocal  residues  vs  500m_1  model,  increase  aggressiveness  from  0.09  
to
 
0.2
 
or
 
even
 
0.3,
 
but
 
it’s
 
destructive
 
for
 
some
 
instruments
 
(at
 
least
 
without
 
Demucs
 
trick
 
above).
   Model:  HP-4BAND-V2_arch-124m  (2_HP-UVR)   !)  Fast  and  nice  model,  but  sometimes  gives  lots  of  vocal  residues  comparing  to  above,  but  
thanks
 
to
 
this,
 
it
 
may
 
sometimes
 
harm
 
snare
 
less
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
(still
 
4
 
times
 
faster
 
than
 
500m_1)
 
it’s
 
~55/45
 
which
 
model
 
is
 
better
 
and
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
album
 
even
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
genre:
   Window  size:  272  (the  lowest  possible;  in  some  very  rare  cases  it  can  spoil  the  result  on  4  
band
 
models,
 
then
 
check
 
320)
 Aggressiveness:  0.09  (9  in  GUI)  TTA:  ON  (instr.  separation  of  a  better  quality)  Postprocess:  (sometimes  on,  it  rather  compliments  to  the  sound  of  this  model  especially  
when
 
the
 
result
 
sounds
 
a
 
bit
 
too
 
harsh,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
can
 
spoil
 
drums
 
in
 
some
 
places
 
when
 
e.g.
 
strong
 
synths
 
suddenly
 
appear
 
in
 
mix
 
for
 
short,
 
probably
 
misidentifying
 
them
 
as
 
vocals,
 
so
 
be
 
aware)
 Mirroring  (it  fits  pretty  well  to  this  model  in  comparison  to  mirroring2  which  is  not  “aggressive”  
enough
 
here)
 
[mirroring
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
present
 
in
 
GUI
 
so
 
be
 
aware)
 Processing  time  for  this  model  is  10  minutes  using  the  weakest  GPU  in  Colab  (but  currently  
you
 
should
 
be
 
getting
 
better
 
Tesla
 
T4).
   (for  users  of  x-minus)  “slightly  different  models  [than  in  GUI]  are  used  for  minimum  
aggressiveness.
 
When
 
we
 
train
 
models,
 
we
 
get
 
many
 
epochs.
 
Some
 
of
 
these
 
models
 
differ
 
in
 
that
 
they
 
better
 
preserve
 
instruments
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
saxophone.
 
These
 
versions
 
of
 
the
 
models
 
don't
 
get
 
into
 
the
 
release,
 
but
 
are
 
used
 
exclusively
 
on
 
the
 
XM
 
website.”
  Model:  HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_1  (9_HP2-UVR)   3)  Older  good  model,  but  resource  heavy  -  check  it  if  you  get  too  many  vocal  residues,  or  in  
other
 
cases
 
-
 
when
 
your
 
drums
 
are
 
too
 
muffled
 
-
 
rarely
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
more
 
bleeding
