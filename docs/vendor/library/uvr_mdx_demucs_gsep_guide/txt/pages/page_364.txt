    Q:  I  convert  a  song  using  v1e+  and  use  phase  fix,  then  do  another  conversion  using  for  
example
 
Gabox
 
V7
 
and
 
use
 
phase
 
fix,
 
if
 
I
 
go
 
back
 
to
 
upload
 
the
 
same
 
song
 
using
 
v1e+
 
it
 
gives
 
the
 
stems
 
instantly
 
but
 
if
 
I
 
use
 
phase
 
fix
 
it
 
will
 
process
 
again,
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
it
 
would
 
remember
 A:  This  may  be  a  temporary  issue.  Sometimes  that  server  may  be  unavailable,  then  
processing
 
will
 
start
 
on
 
another
 
server.
 Q:  What’s  “include  results  from  independent  models”?  A:  “When  you  use  an  ensemble,  you  will  also  get  results  from  each  model  of  the  ensemble  
and
 
not
 
only
 
the
 
ensemble
 
final
 
result.”
 Q:  What  means  “Disown  Expired  Separations”  option  A:  “we  do  not  delete  expired  separation  data  (they  are  needed  for  analytics),  but  just  remove  
your
 
ownership
 
from
 
expired
 
separations
 We  could  have  written  delete  expired  separations,  but  wanted  to  be  more  clear  about  your  
data”
 Q:  “So  I  understand,  all  the  uploads  are  kept,  regardless  of  'disowning'  or  not.  So  what  is  the  
distinction
 
between
 
disowning
 
and
 
not
 
disowning?
 
Is
 
there
 
one?”
 
 A:  no  uploads  are  kept,  just  settings.  If  you  disown,  you  won't  see  your  expired  separations   Q:  I  will  need  a  refresher  in  terms.  Separations  are  created  from  (audio)  uploads.  
Separations
 
are
 
also
 
not
 
kept?
 
Only
 
the
 
settings
 
used,
 
i.e.
 
kuielab_a_drums,
 
aufr33-jarredou_DrumSep_model_mdx23c_ep_141_sdr_10.8059,
 
and
 
whatever
 
segment,
 
aggression,
 
vocal
 
only,
 
etc
 
are
 
selected
 
at
 
the
 
point
 
of
 
hitting
 
'do
 
it'..
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
of
 
speaking..
 A:  separation  is  when  you  choose  settings  and  upload  file,  we  just  save  the  settings  and  
delete
 
file.
 Q:  How  to  use  the  same  file  over  and  over  for  different  models  in  order  to  test  them,  but  
without
 
reuploading
 
the
 
same
 
file
 
over
 
and
 
over
 A:  “You  can  use  remote  upload  for  this.  Just  use  link  on  file  from  previous  separation.  So  you  will  not  need  to  upload  anything.  https://mvsep.com/remote”   x-minus.pro /  uvronlione.app (-||-,  10  minute  daily  limit  for  free,  very  fast,  mp3  192kbps  output  for  free  (lossless  for  premium),  some  exclusive  models  for  paid  users,  Roformers  will
