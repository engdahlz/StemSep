    A:  The  two  files  outside  the  ensemble  folder  are  the  final  ensembled  files.  The  folder  is  all  the  separate  outputs  from  each  model  (you've  enabled  that  in  settings)  Q:  Those  files  are  final  after  they  went  through  all  the  models,  right?  Not  just  the  DeEcho  
model.
 A:  Yes  Q:  I  am  just  suspicious  of  the  naming,  I  see  at  the  time,  and  it  makes  sense  that  the  files  
outside
 
the
 
directory
 
are
 
the
 
final
 
version
 
although
 
are
 
they
 
after
 
all
 
the
 
models
 
or
 
just
 
1
 
model.
 A:  The  naming  is  just  whatever  stem  is  assigned  to  the  models,  in  your  case  all  the  models  
output
 
echo
 
and
 
no
 
echo
 
file
 so  the  final  ensemble  files  will  have  that  in  the  name   -  Q:  What  is  this  "band"  that  I  keep  seeing  in  the  spectrograph  of  tracks  that  I've  isolated  with  x-minus?  A:  MDX  noise  -  a  noise  it  produces  no  matter  what.  In  UVR  you  can  use  denoise  
standard/model
 
in
 
options>Advanced
 
MDX-Net
 
it
 
will
 
do
 
exactly
 
what
 
the
 
below
 
describes:
 You  can  either  use  UVR  De-noise  model  or  isolate  the  track  twice.  Once  normal  one  and  
already
 
inverted,
 then  you  add  the  results  of  normal-inst,  inverted-inst,  reinvert  the  inverted-inst,  merge  both  
normal
 
and
 
reinverted-inst.
 The  merged  will  be  without  noise,  but  6  dBs  higher  -  so  lower  the  gain  accordingly,  and  you'll  
get
 
the
 
same,
 
just
 
no
 
noise.
 
Repeat
 
that
 
for
 
vocals
 
obviously.
  -  Q:  voc_ft  doesn’t  have  any  spectrum  above  17.7kHz.  How  to  restore  it,  and  have  e.g.  
48kHz
 
or
 
96kHz
 
output
 
like
 
the
 
input
 
file
 
has?
 A:  Turn  off  “Match  Freq  Cut-off”  but  it  copies  the  remaining  frequencies  from  the  original,  
leading
 
to
 
possibly
 
more
 
noise.
 “if  you  want  true  96  kHz  you  need  to  manually  lower  the  rate  for  44100  Hz  or  less  since  the  
models
 
themselves
 
are
 
44100
 
Hz”
  -  It  can  happen  that  VR  models  using  512  window  size  can  crash  on  4GB  cards,  but  272  will  
be
 
fine,
 
although
 
it
 
will
 
take
 
more
 
time
  Q:  “I  have  tried  everything  and  also  googled  a  lot,  but  UVR  with  MDX-Net  is  producing  me  
this
 
type
 
of
 
noise
 
in
 
every
 
sample
 
I
 
have
 
tried,
 
that
 
was
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
recording
 
before.
 
Anybody
 
have
 
an
 
idea
 
what
 
can
 
cause
 
it?”
  A:  “It’s  just  part  of  the  architecture.  Either  run  it  through  a  denoise  model  or  run  it  through  it  
twice
 
with
 
the
 
second
 
time
 
the
 
sound
 
being
 
phase-inverted”
 “Enabling  Denoise  Output  should  do  the  trick.  I  use  the  Denoise  Model  option,  seems  to  
work
 
quite
 
well,
 
to
 
my
 
ears,
 
at
 
least”
  Q:  “Is  there  any  way  to  fix  the  uvr  bve  model  saying  "vocals"  on  the  bgv  and  "instrumental"  
on
 
the
 
lead
 
vocal
 
file?
 
It's
 
unbelievably
 
annoying”
