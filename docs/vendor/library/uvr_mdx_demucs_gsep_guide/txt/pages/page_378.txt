  FAQ   Q:  “When  running  inference,  I  am  getting  tired  of  it  creating  a  folder  for  each  input  file  and  
putting
 
individual
 
stems
 
inside
 
that
 
folder.
 
Especially
 
since
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
I'm
 
running
 
single
 
stem
 
models
 
and
 
I
 
only
 
need
 
the
 
primary
 
stem.
 
I
 
remember
 
on
 
a
 
much
 
older
 
version,
 
it
 
wouldn't
 
create
 
folders,
 
it
 
would
 
just
 
copy
 
the
 
original
 
filename
 
and
 
put
 
the
 
stem
 
name
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
it.
 
So
 
I
 
was
 
wondering
 
what
 
I
 
could
 
modify
 
in
 
newer
 
versions
 
to
 
restore
 
that
 
behavior.
 
I'm
 
guessing
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
in
 
inference.py,
 
but
 
don't
 
exactly
 
know
 
where
 
to
 
look.”

today.
 
I
 
noticed
 
that
 
the
 
gui-wx.py
 
file
 
was
 
moved
 
to
 
the
 
gui
 
folder
 
(it
 
used
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
the
 
root).
 
So
 
now
 
when
 
I
 
try
 
to
 
launch
 
the
 
gui,
 
I
 
get
 
file
 
not
 
found
 
errors.
 
Gui
 
still
 
works
 
at
 
least
 
for
 
screen
 
reader
 
users
 
like
 
myself,
 
but
 
these
 
errors
 
should
 
definitely
 
be
 
fixed.
 I'm  wondering  if  I  should  be  trying  to  launch  the  gui  from  the  main  msst  folder,  or  if  I  should  
be
 
launching
 
it
 
from
 
the
 
gui
 
folder.
 
Either
 
way
 
I
 
get
 
errors.
 
I
 
could
 
fix
 
them
 
by
 
modifying
 
paths
 
in
 
gui-wx.py,
 
just
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
which
 
folder
 
I
 
should
 
be
 
starting
 
from
 
lol”
