     Here  are  some  tips  for  improving  the  signal  strength  of  the  SDR  when  using  spectral  
inversion:
  *  Use  a  high-quality  input.  The  better  the  quality  of  the  signal,  the  less  likely  it  is  that  the  SDR  
will
 
lose
 
signal
 
strength
 
when
 
the
 
spectrum
 
is
 
inverted.

 Further,  there  is  also  about  picking  a  good  inversion  algorithm  and  experimenting  with  
different
 
ones,
 
but
 
UVR
 
seems
 
to
 
have
 
one
 
to
 
pick
 
anyway.
  Q:  I  noticed  https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/leaderboard2.php?id=2967 has  Spectral  Inversion  off  for  MDX  but  on  for  Demucs.  The  Spectral  Inversion  toggle  seems  
to
 
apply
 
to
 
both
 
models,
 
so
 
should
 
it
 
be
 
on
 
or
 
off?
  A:  Good  catch.  Once  u  put  it  on  for  one  or  the  other,  both  will  be  affected  indeed.  I've  enabled  it  (so  for  both,  actually)  [for  this  result].   _____   MDX  v3  parameters  (e.g.  MDX23C-InstVoc  HQ  and  2  and  MDX23C_D1581)   (biggest  measured  SDR)  Segment  Size:  512  Overlap:  16   (default)  Segment  Size:  256  Overlap:  8   The  “512/16  is  slightly  better  for  big  cost  of  time”  vs  the  default  256/8.   -  On  a  GPU  with  lots  of  VRAM  (e.g.  24GB),  you  can  run  two  instances  of  UVR,  so  the  
processing
 
will
 
be
 
faster.
 
You
 
only
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
4096
 
segmentation
 
instead
 
of
 
8192.
   
It
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
fully
 
correct
 
to
 
evaluate
 
segment
 
and
 
overlap
 
SDR-wise
 
based
 
on
 
measurements
 
done
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset,
 
as
 
every
 
single
 
file
 
in
 
the
 
dataset
 
is
 
shorter
 
than
 
average
 
normal
 
track,
 
and
 
that
 
might
 
potentially
 
lead
 
to
 
creating
 
more
 
segments
 
and
 
different
 
overlaps
 
than
 
with
 
normal
 
tracks,
 
so
 
achieved
 
results
 
won’t
 
fully
 
reflect
 
normal
 
separation
 
use
 
cases
 
(if
 
e.g.
 
number
 
of
 
segments
 
is
 
dependent
 
on
 
input
 
file).
 
Potentially,
 
the
 
problem
 
could
 
be
 
solved
 
by
 
increasing
 
overlap
 
and
 
segments
 
for
 
a
 
full
 
length
 
song
 
to
 
achieve
 
the
 
same
 
SDR
 
as
 
with
 
its
 
fragment
 
from
 
multisong
 
dataset.
