    Because  the  bot  rips  from  Qobuz,  it’s  the  best  source  of  24  bit  files  which  I  recommend  if  
only
 
available
 
(either
 
44,
 
48
 
or
 
96kHz)
 
as
 
it
 
delivers
 
FLACs
 
for
 
end
 
users,
 
instead
 
of
 
partly
 
lossy
 
MQA
 
on
 
Tidal
 
when
 
some
 
album/song
 
uses
 
Master
 
quality
 
which
 
is
 
compulsory
 
for
 
24
 
bit
 
(44/48)
 
there,
 
but
 
MQA
 
16
 
bit
 
and
 
Master
 
is
 
also
 
possible
 
for
 
some
 
albums
 
(and
 
you
 
should
 
avoid
 
16
 
bit
 
MQA).
 
Of
 
course
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
some
 
exceptions
 
where
 
24
 
bit
 
MQA
 
on
 
Tidal
 
will
 
sound
 
better
 
than
 
FLAC
 
24
 
bit
 
on
 
Qobuz
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned
 
above
 
-
 
the
 
example
 
is
 
Eminem
 
-
 
Music
 
To
 
Be
 
Murdered
 
By
 
(Deluxe
 
Edition)
 
-
 
Volume
 
1
 
(the
 
newer
 
Side
 
B,
 
track
 
-
 
Book
 
of
 
Rhymes).
  For  using  Deezer  links  with  bot,  you  need  to  find  a  song/album,  use  option  to  share  a  link  to  
track
 
or
 
album,
 
then
 
open
 
the
 
shared
 
link
 
so
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
redirected,
 
and
 
then
 
rename
 
the
 
link
 
to
 
this
 
form
 
for
 
a
 
single
 
song
 
(otherwise
 
bot
 
will
 
return
 
“processing”
 
instead
 
of
 
ripping
 
or
 
even
 
possible
 
error):
 https://www.deezer.com/en/track/XXXXXXX  (ARLs  trick  doesn’t  work  anymore)  Hint:  There's  also  something  like  ARL,  which  is  a  cookie's  
session
 
identifier
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
shared,
 
so
 
everyone
 
can
 
log
 
into
 
the
 
premium
 
account
 
and
 
download
 
FLACs
 
with
 
ARLs
 
of
 
different
 
regions
 
and
 
regional
 
locks.
 
Might
 
be
 
useful
 
for
 
some
 
specific
 
tracks.
 
ARLs
 
are
 
frequently
 
shared
 
online,
 
though
 
harder
 
to
 
find
 
nowadays
 
(Reddit
 
censorship).
 IRC,  Deemix  might  use  ARLs  beside  regular  account  log  in  process.    5)  Tidal  Downloader  Pro (the  fastest  method  for  batch  and  local  downloading)  in  GUI.  HiFi  Plus  subscription  is  no  longer  necessary,  just  valid  Hi-Fi  subscription  (for  at  least  Hi-Fi  
albums,
 
the
 
two
 
are
 
merged
 
in
 
one
 
for
 
the
 
price
 
of
 
the
 
cheaper
 
now).
  You  won’t  be  able  to  download  with  better  quality  than  24  bit/48kHz  and  in  Atmos  with  this  downloader  (then  use  orpheusdl_tidal instead,  or  tidal-dl-ng -  but  for  that  one  I’m  not  sure  if  it  downloads  Atmos  files)   Install  Tidal  app  on  Windows  and  log  in,  then  open  the  downloader  and  click  log,  copy  and  
paste
 
the
 
given
 
code
 
in
 
the
 
opened
 
browser
 
tab
 
and
 
voila.
  Or  if  that  GUI  temporarily  doesn’t  work,  go  to:  https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader/releases and  download  the  newest  source  code.  It  contains  CMD  version  for  downloading,  located  in:  
Tidal-Media-Downloader-202x.xx.xx.x\TIDALDL-PY\exe
 Documentation:  https://doc.yaronzz.com/post/tidal_dl_installation/  If  you  have  problems  with  running  the  app  and  people  also  write  in  GitHub  issues  that  the  
current
 
version
 
is
 
not
 
working,
 
keep
 
tracking
 
new
 
versions,
 
or
 
read
 
all
 
the
 
issues
 
about
 
this
 
version,
 
it
 
may
 
happen
 
that
 
someone
 
else
 
will
 
update
 
the
 
app
 
before.
