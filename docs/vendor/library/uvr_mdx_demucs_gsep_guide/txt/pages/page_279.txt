    Average/Average  is  currently  the  best  for  ensemble  (the  best  SDR  -  compared  with  Min/Max,  
Max/Min,
 
Max/Max).
 “Ensemble  is  not  the  same  as  chopping/cutting  off  and  stitching,  it  blends/removes  
frequencies.
 
If
 
song
 
1
 
has
 
high
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
chorus,
 
and
 
song
 
2
 
has
 
deep
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
chorus,
 
max
 
will
 
mash
 
them
 
together,
 
so
 
the
 
final
 
song
 
will
 
have
 
both
 
high
 
and
 
deep
 
vocals
 while  min  will  remove  both  vocals”  "If  I  ensembled  with  max,  it  would  add  a  lot  of  noise  and  hiss,  if  I  ensemble  with  min  it  would  
make
 
the
 
overall
 
sound
 
muted
 
gsep."
  Technical  explanation  on  min/avg/max   Max  -  keeps  the  frequencies  that  are  the  same  and  adds  the  different  ones  “Max  spec  tends  to  give  more  artifacts  as  it's  always  selecting  the  loudest  spectrogram  
frequency
 
bins
 
in
 
each
 
stft
 
frames.
 
So
 
if
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
inputs
 
have
 
artifacts
 
when
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
silent,
 
and
 
even
 
if
 
all
 
other
 
inputs
 
are
 
silent
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
instant,
 
max
 
spec
 
will
 
select
 
the
 
artifacts,
 
as
 
it's
 
the
 
max
 
loud
 
part
 
of
 
spectrogram
 
here.”

  Min  -  keeps  the  frequencies  that  are  the  same  and  removes  any  different  ones   "if  the  phases  of  the  frequencies  are  not  similar  enough  min  spec  and  max  spec  algorithms  
for
 
ensembles
 
will
 
create
 
noisy
 
artifacts
 
(IDK
 
how
 
to
 
explain
 
them,
 
it
 
just
 
kinda
 
sounds
 
washy),
 
so
 
it's
 
often
 
safer
 
to
 
go
 
with
 
average"
  by  Vinctekan  "Min  =  Detects  the  common  frequencies  between  outputs,  and  deletes  the  different  ones,  
keeps
 
the
 
same
 
ones.
  Max  =  Detects  the  common  frequencies  between  outputs,  and  adds  the  difference  to  them.   Now  you  would  think  that  Max-Spec  would  be  perfect  since  it  should  combine  the  all  of  the  
strengths
 
of
 
every
 
model,
 
therefore
 
it's
 
probably
 
the
 
best
 
option
  That  would  be  the  case  if  it  wasn't  for  the  fact  that  the  algorithms  that  are  used  are  not  
perfect,
 
and
 
I
 
posted
 
multiples
 
tests
 
to
 
confirm
 
this.
  However,  it  still  gives  probably  the  cleanest  results,  however,  there  are  a  few  issues  with  
said
 
Max_Spec:
  1.  Lot  of  instrumentals  are  going  to  be  left  within  the  output  2.  If  you  are  looking  to  measure  quality  by  SDR,  don't  expect  it  to  be  better  than  avg/avg   The  average  algorithm,  basically,  combine  all  the  outputs  and  averages  them.  Like  the  
average
 
function
 
in
 
Excel.
