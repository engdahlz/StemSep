     Q:  Question  about  MVSEP  BS  Roformer  2025.07.  Is  this  a  model  I  can  download,  or  do  I  
have
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
online
 
on
 
their
 
site?
 
I
 
can't
 
find
 
it.
 A:  It's  mvsep  site  only.  No  download.  So  you  want  to  use  this  model,  must  go  mvsep.com  Q:  What  exactly  are  we  doing  with  a  Phase  Fixer/Swapper?  As  an  audio  engineer,  I  
understand
 
phase
 
as
 
how
 
it
 
relates
 
to
 
frequency
 
over
 
time.
 
When
 
a
 
vocal
 
stem
 
is
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
"reference"
 
for
 
the
 
target
 
instrumental
 
stem,
 
what's
 
actually
 
happening?
  A:  “There  is  a  phase  in  the  waveform  domain,  like  audio  engineers  experience  it  every  day,  
and
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
phase
 
in
 
the
 
STFT
 
domain.
 
In
 
STFT
 
domain
 
phase
 
means
 
how
 
each
 
STFT
 
bins
 
content
 
is
 
organized
 
with
 
other
 
bins.
 The  math  concept  is  similar  to  phase  in  the  waveform  domain,  but  instead  of  having  1  phase  
value
 
for
 
1
 
waveform,
 
you
 
have
 
1
 
value
 
for
 
each
 
STFT
 
bin
 
and
 
for
 
each
 
STFT
 
frame,
 
so
 
it's
 
way
 
more
 
complex...
 
(to
 
make
 
it
 
really
 
short).
 The  phase  fixer/swapper  thing  is  operating  in  the  STFT  domain,  so  for  each  STFT  bins,  it  will  
use
 
the
 
magnitude
 
data
 
of
 
1
 
model,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
phase
 
data
 
from
 
another
 
model,
 
and
 
hopefully
 
this
 
can
 
improve
 
the
 
final
 
result”.

  “In  short,  what  the  script  does  is  blend  the  stft  phase  of  the  "donor"  file  into  the  target,  it  uses  
different
 
blending
 
scales
 
for
 
different
 
frequencies
 
so
 
that
 
it'll
 
only
 
affect
 
the
 
parts
 
that
 
are
 
directly
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
perceived
 
noise”

  Q:  Apparently  the  original  Resurrection  model  only  has  two  models  (BS-Roformer  1296/1297  
by
 
viperx
 
and
 
BS
 
Large
 
V1
 
by
 
unwa)
 
that
 
work
 
for
 
phase
 
fixer,
 
but
 
the
 
Gabox
 
one
 
says
 
to
 
use
 
2025.7
 
for
 
phase
 
fixer
 
(which
 
works
 
almost
 
perfectly)
 
How
 
does
 
that
 
happen?
 
How
 
did
 
the
 
working
 
models
 
change
 
for
 
Gabox's
 
fine
 
tune?
  A:  ML  models  are  black  boxes.  You  never  know  what  you'll  get.  Like  in  Forrest  Gump.  It  
depends
 
on
 
the
 
specific
 
instrumental
 
model,
 
which
 
vocal
 
model
 
as
 
the
 
source
 
for
 
the
 
phase
 
fixer
 
will
 
work
 
the
 
best.
