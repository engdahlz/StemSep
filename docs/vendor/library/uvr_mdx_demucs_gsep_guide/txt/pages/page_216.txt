    Might  be  still  usable  in  some  specific  cases,  despite  the  fact  that  MDX23  uses  demucs_ft

other
 
models
 
combined.
  -  VR  models settings  +  VR-only  ensemble  settings (generally  deprecated,  but  sometimes  more  clarity  vs  MDX  v1,  though  frequently  more  vocal  residues.  Some  people  still  uses  it  
e.g.
 
for
 
some
 
rock,
 
when
 
it

results

 Similarity  Extractor instead,  but  Audacity  center  extraction  works  better  than  that  linked  Colab)   -  Alternatively,  you  can  consider  using  narrowband  Kim  other  ft  model  with  fullband  model  settings  parameters  in  this or  the  new  HV  Colab  instead.  Useful  in  some  specific  parts  of  songs  like  chorus,  where  there  are  still  no  persistent  vocal  residues  using  this  method  
(clearer
 
results
 
than
 
even
 
Max-Spec)
 
or
 
e.g.
 
MDX23
 
still
 
doesn't
 
give
 
you
 
enough
 
clarity
 
in
 
such
 
places
 
to
 
maybe
 
merge
 
fragments
 
manually
 
of
 
results
 
from
 
different

 4  stems  might  be  better  at  times  then  Demucs  ft  model.  -  Dango.AI (a.k.a.  tuanziai.com)  free  30  seconds  samples;  can  be  the  most  aggressive  for  instrumentals  vs,  e.g.  inst  3,  tested  on  Childish  Gambino  -  Algorithm).  Since  then,  
models/arch
 
were
 
updated

instrumentals
 
in
 
9.0
 
seem
 
to
 
be

 >  If  you  care  only  about  specific  snippet  in  a  song,  then  since  30  second  samples  to  
separate
 
are
 
taken
 
randomly
 
from
 
a
 
whole
 
song,
 
to
 
have

fragment
 
separated,
 
you
 
can

the

fragment
 
over
 
and
 
over
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
full-length
 
track
 
of
 
it,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
eventually
 
pick
 
up
 
a
 
whole
 
snippet
 
for
 
separation.
