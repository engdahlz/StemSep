    Q:  Problem  is...  It  simply  takes  too  much  time,  copying  to  cpu  and  back  is  expensive  
resource-wise
 A:  In  some  part  of  torchlibrosa  they  use  a  workaround  for  nn.functional.fold  function,  maybe  
that
 
can
 
be
 
reproduced/adapted
 
to
 
the
 
other
 
failing
 
part
 
where
 
fold
 
used.
 A:  line  239  is  the  drop  in,  you  have  to  make  sure  the  settings  are  the  same  from  what  i  
remember

 Q:  It  got  thru  the  whole  ass  forward  step.  But  now  it's  stuck  at  backward  step.  yk,  recalculate  the  weights  based  on  this  step  to  improve  the  model.   replaced  the  backwards  function  of  stft  with  empty  one,  and  yet:  stuck.  so  since  backwards  step  of  stft/istft  is  disabled...  the  problem  is  elsewhere.   No  idea  where,  no  idea  how  to  debug,  out  of  my  expertise.  A:  I  might  be  100%  wrong  here,  but  I  think  you  should  disable  the  backward  pass  through  
that

it
 
is
