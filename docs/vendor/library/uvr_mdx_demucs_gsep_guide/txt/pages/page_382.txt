changes

  You  should  be  able  to  modify  it  to  use  with  three  models  and  different  weights  like  3,  2,  2  in

Demucs4

the

it

like

in

Joining  frequencies  from  two  models   Sometimes  it  may  happen  that  a  regular  ensemble  even  with  min  spec  doesn't  give  you  
complete
 
freedom
 
over
 
what
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
achieve,
 
having
 
one
 
cleaner
 
narrowband
 
model
 
result
 
with
 
fullband
 
model
 
result
 
with
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues,
 
but
 
you
 
still
 
want
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
full
 
spectrum.
  Instead  of  using  ensemble  Colab,  you  can  also  mix  in  some  DAW,  MDX-UVR  464/inst3  or  
Kim
 
inst
 
model
 
result
 
which
 
have
 
17.7Hz
 
cutoff,
 
with
 
HQ_1-5
 
or
 
Demucs
 
4
 
result,
 
which
 
has
 
full
 
22kHz
 
training
 
frequency
 
model.
  First,  import  both  tracks.  Now  rather  the  most  correct  attitude  to  avoid  any  noise  or  frequency  overlapping  is  to  use brickwall  highpass in  EQ  at  17680Hz  everywhere  on  Demucs  4  stems,  and  leave  MDX  untouched,  and  just  it.  You  can  use  GSEP  instead  of  
Demucs
 
4
 
(possibly
 
less
 
vocal
 
residues).
  If  you  want  to  experiment  further,  as  for  a  cut-off,  once  I  ended  up  with  17725.00  flat  high  
pass
 
with
 
-12dB
 
slope
 
for
 
"drums"
 
in
 
Izotope
 
Elements
 
EQ
 
Analog
 
and
 
I
 
left
 
MDX
 
untouched.
 
“Bass”
 
stem
 
set
 
to
 
17680.00
 
in
 
mono
 
and
 
"other"
 
in
 
stereo
 
at
 
17680.00
 
with
 
Maximiser
 
with
 
IRC

But
 
it
 
might
 
produce
 
hissy
 
hi-hat
 
in
 
places
 
with
 
less
 
busy
 
mix
 
or
 
when
 
hi-hat
 
is
 
very
 
fast,
 
so
 
tweak
 
it
 
to
 
your
 
liking.
  For  free  EQ  you  can  use  e.g.  TDR  Nova  -  click  LP  and  set  17.7  and  slope  -72dB.  As  a  free  DAW  you  can  use  free  Audacity  (new  versions  support  VST)  or  Cakewalk,  Pro  
Tools
 
Intro,
 
or
 
Ableton
 
Lite.
  The  result  of  above  will  probably  cause  a  small  hole  in  a  spectrum,  and  a  bit  lack  of  clarity.  
Alternatively,
 
you
 
can
 
apply
 
resonant
 
high
 
pass
 
instead
 
of
 
brickwall,
 
so
 
the
 
whole
 
will
 
be
 
filled
 
without
 
overlapping
 
frequencies.
