     -  (uvronline.app/x-minus)  New  electric  and  acoustic  guitar  models  by  viperx'  added  on  the  
site
 
for
 
premium
 
users.
 Acoustic  seems  to  be  good,  while  electric  might  be  more  problematic  at  times.   -  Now  lalal.ai  have  some  voc/inst  models  sounding  like  some  ensemble  of  public  Roformers,  
but
 
still
 
not
 
as
 
good,
 
although
 
close.
 
Some
 
of
 
their
 
specific
 
models
 
are
 
worth
 
trying
 
out,
 
e.g.
 
lead
 
guitars
 
-
 
the
 
model
 
got
 
better
 
by
 
the
 
time,
 
or
 
also
 
piano
 
model
  -  https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo |  jarredou  Colab jarredou:  “New  tool  for  heavily  compressed  mp3  restoration,  using  bandsplitting  and  
roformers.
 
It
 
does
 
work
 
really
 
great
 
if
 
the
 
audio
 
was
 
compressed
 
at
 
44.1khz
 
sample
 
rate,
 
whatever
 
bitrate
 
[<=128kbps].
 
BUT
 
if
 
there
 
was
 
some
 
resampling
 
leading
 
to
 
hard
 
cutoff,
 
it
 
will
 
wrongly
 
behave.
 The  current  model  of  Apollo  was  only  trained  on  mp3  compressed  audio.  If  you  use  
ogg/opus/m4a/whatever
 
else
 
compressed
 
audio
 
as
 
input,
 
it's
 
not
 
guaranteed
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
work
 
as
 
expected.”
  It  was  also  added  on  MVSEP  as  "Apollo  MP3  Enhancer":  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20240919224117-f0bb276157-mixture.wav  Advice  "Good  use  case:  Input  has  no  hard  cutoff  (quality  slowly  degrades  toward  high  freq).  Generated  output  is  as  expected.  It  can  fill  holes,  and  it  can  remove  artifacts  (and  probably  
bleeding
 
too)
 
and
 
is
 
working
 
great
 
with
 
highly
 
degraded
 
audio
 
here.
 
If
 
trained
 
on
 
clean
 
source
 
vs
 
separated
 
stem,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
as
 
much
 
degraded
 
content
 
than
 
32kbps
 
mp3
 
like
 previous  example,  I  think  it  could  work  really  great”  [bad  use  case]  “so  far  the  overlap  magic  is  needed,  cause  u  hear  the  transition”  “It  seems  to  alter  the  tempo.  It's  not  a  constant  alteration,  it  just  shifts  stuff,  and  you  can't  
invert”

 >  “I've  seen  this  too  in  my  tests,  but  it  seems  to  happen  only  at  the  end  of  the  chunk.  In  the  updated  version  (in  which  the  end  of  chunks  is  ditched),  I  haven't  seen  that  issue  
again.
 >Overlap  feature  added  [to  the  Colab].  New  inference.py  created  for  easier  local  CLI  use.  I  have  set  chunk_size  at  3  seconds  as  default  in  the  Colab  because  it  was  the  chunk_size  
used
 
to
 
train
 
the
 
model,
 
but
 
it
 
seems
 
that
 
the
 
highest
 
is
 
the
 
best.”

 It  was  also  added  into  ZFTurbo’s  training  dataset  (read  more).  Also,  for  non-mp3  input  files,  you  might  want  to  experiment  with  compressing  them  to  
64kbps
 
first.
  -  Also,  TS-BSmamba2  was  added  to  the  repo.  So  it's  available  for  training  now  too.  But  
currently
 
it
 
works
 
only
 
on
 
Linux.
