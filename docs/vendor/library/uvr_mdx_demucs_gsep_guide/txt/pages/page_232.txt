    “The  model  doesn't  keep  the  backing  vocals  below  the  main  vocals,  sometimes  the  backing  
vocals
 
will
 
be

there

there.”
  -  anvuew  dereverb Mel-Roformer  model  v2  (“on  some  songs  I  tried  it  worked  better  than  karaoke  models”)  not  for  duets,  it  debleeds  too,  “cleaner  backing  vocals  [than  the  below],  
can
 
sometimes
 
mistake

vocals
 
from
 
a
 
track,

when

it
 
can

vocals

also
 
better

the

 “Demix  is  better  for  keeping  background  vocals  yes,  but  for  the  lead  ones  they  tend  to  sound  
weaker

spectrum
 
isn’t
 
as
 
full

has
 
more
 
holes
 
than

this
 
isn’t
 
always
 
a
 
bad
 
thing
 
because
 
the

themselves
 
are
 
cleaner,
 
the

might

you
