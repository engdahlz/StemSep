    -  BS/Mel-Roformer  UVR  beta  patch   
For  GPU  acceleration,  UVR  currently  supports:   
CUDA
 
(NVIDIA
 
GPUs)/DirectML
 
(AMD
 
and
 
Intel
 
GPUs;
 
previously
 
misnamed
 
as
 
OpenCL)/MPS
 
(Mac
 
M1
 
[ARM]/x86-64),
 
and
 
even
 
old
 
CPUs
 
(AMD
 
A6-9225
 
Dual-Core
 
or
 
Intel
 
Core
 
2
 
Quad
 
[models
 
with
 
SSE4.1
 
tested]).
 
DirectML
 
is
 
not
 
supported
 
for
 
Apollo,
 
Bandit
 
(also
 
incompatible
 
with
 
MPS),
 
SCNet
 
and
 
probably
 
Demucs
 
2
 
archs
 
-
 
CPU
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
automatically.
 
 
Model
 
architectures
 
supported:
 
 
MDX-Net,
 
MDX23C
 
(archs
 
by
 
kuielab),
 
VR
 
(voice-remover
 
by
 
tsurumeso,
 
v.
 
4,
 
5
 
[UVR
 
fork],
 
5.1),
 
Demucs
 
(arch
 
by
 
Meta;
 
v.
 
1-4,
 
only
 
models
 
trained
 
on
 
OG
 
code,
 
not
 
MSST
 
ones),
 
BS-Roformer,
 
Mel-Roformer
 
(arch
 
by
 
Bytedance
 
&
 
impl.
 
by
 
lucidrains;
 
issues
 
on
 
Linux
 
explained
 
later),
 
SCNet,
 
Apollo
 
(in
 
Tools;
 
for
 
upscaling,
 
no
 
DirectML
 
acceleration),
 
BandIt
 
(SFX,
 
no
 
DirectML).
 
It  has  also  a  feature  of  ensemble  MDX  models  with  different  archs  like  MDX23C/v3  or  
Roformers,
 
VR.
 
Demudder
 
added
 
in
 
newer
 
patches
 
(currently
 
not
 
on
 
Linux).
 
Models  for  Roformers/SCNet/Bandit  arch  are  located  altogether  in  the  MDX-Net  menu.  
Apollo  upscaler  (Apollo)  is  located  in  Tools.  
 
Don’t
 
forget
 
to
 
enable
 
GPU
 
Conversion
 
-
 
if
 
it
 
works,
 
it
 
speeds
 
up
 
separation
 
hugely.

 -  If  your  separation  on  DirectML  stuck,  decrease  chunk_size.
