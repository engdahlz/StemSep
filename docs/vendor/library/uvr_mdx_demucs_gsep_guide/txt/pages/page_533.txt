[page 533/642]
    It's  not  a  final  version.  I've  realised  after  generating  130h  of  audio  data  that  I've  made  a  
mistake
 
in
 
routing,
 
leading
 
to
 
some
 
occasional
 
cowbell
 
in
 
snare
 
stems.
 
So
 
it's
  
[Kick/Snare-cowbell/Toms/HiHat/Ride/Crash]
 
stems.
 
 I've  stopped  it's  rendering  and  will  not  make  the  final  "mastering"  stage  that  was  planned.   I  will  make  a  clean  no-cowbell  version,  but  as  I'm  lacking  free  time,  I  don't  know  when,  and  
as
 
this
 
one
 
is
 
here
 
and
 
already
 
great
 
sounding
 
why
 
not
 
using
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
meantime.
  Just  don't  mind  the  cowbell!”   Looks  like  it’s  the  thing:  http://rigaudio.fr/datasets/DrumsDataset.zip   Newer  version  in  a  better  formatted  version,  with  train/valid  separated  parts,  generated  
mixtures
 
and
 
a
 
fixed
 
filename
 
that
 
was
 
containing
 
an
 
extra
 
space:
 https://rigaudio.fr/datasets/DrumsDatasetv2.zip (25GB)  (still  the  same  issues  with  some  occasional  cowbell  in  snare  stems.  “There  are  also  few  
other
 
percussions
 
here
 
and
 
there
 
on
 
some
 
little
 
parts
 
for
 
some
 
tracks
 
(like
 
tambourine
 
in
 
ride
 
stem).”)
  “I  realise  now  that  I  totally  forgot  to  lowercase  all  filenames  before  reuploading  the  dataset.   To  avoid  issues  where  some  awaited  filenames  are  hardcoded  in  ZFTurbo's  script,  the  best  
way
 
is
 
so
 
to
 
lowercase
 
all
 
filenames
 
in
 
train/valid
 
parts,
 
convert
 
the
 
valid
 
part
 
to
 
.wav
 
files
 
(no
 
need
 
for
 
the
 
train
 
part
 
that
 
can
 
handle
 
flac
 
correctly).
 And  lowercase  the  stem  names  in  training  part  of  the  config  file  accordingly.”   “Can  probably  be  useful  to  create  electro  drums  separation  dataset,  free  50,000  drums  MIDI
