    “It  is  wonderful  to  achieve  such  results  with  dim  256.  It  seems  that  what  was  still  needed  was  
depth.”
 A  bit  scared  to  share  it,  but  seek  and  ye  shall  find.  Usage:  python  inference.py  --audio_path="./sample.flac"  For:  ModuleNotFoundError:  No  module  named  'hyper_connections'  Run:  pip  install  hyper_connections  “looks  like  chunks  aren't  overlapping?  Getting  clicks  in  output.”  “A  very  small  edit,  line  13:  parser.add_argument('--chunk_size',  type=int,  default=588800)   -  this  produces  99%  identical  results  with  the  DAW.  Previous  117760  chunk  size  was  adding  clicks  and  was  lower  quality  in  general.”  Still,  the  code  doesn’t  use  overlap,  and  it  will  result  in  click,  just  less  than  before.  
Also,
 
you
 
can
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
memory
 
with
 
588800
 
with
 
5GB
 
VRAM
 
free.
 
882000
 
was
 
tested
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
biggest
 
SDR
 
in
 
that
 
model
 
(not
 
lower
 
or
 
higher).
 On  a  CPU  without  an  Nvidia  GPU  it  will  probably  be  long.  The  inference  script  and  model  probably  still  needs  the  validation  to  ensure  the  metrics  are  the  same  with  the  validation made  from  DAW  lately,  but  it’s  rather  the  same  (at  least  other  inference  code  got  0.03  SDR  difference  or  same  results  based  on  the  same  converted  
weights).
 To  use  it  with  ZFTurbo  MSST  repo:  
“You
 
need
 
to
 
replace
 
bs_roformer.py
 
in
 
the
 
repo
 
with
 
file
 
from
 
the
 
archive
 
(...)
 
and
 
change
 
line
 
8
 
to:
 from  models.bs_roformer.attend  import  Attend”  and  then  use  separately  shared  config  for  
the
 
MSST
 
repo
 
and
 
the
 
model.
 
Using
 
MSST
 
repo
 
for
 
inferencing
 
fixes
 
the
 
clicking
 
issue.
 For  “unrecognized  arguments”  issue,  “you  must  put  your  path  inside  quotation  marks  or  
apostrophes”.
 “If  you're  using  the  script  GUI,  be  aware  that  the  browser  popup  window  when  choosing  
checkpoint
 
has
 
some
 
predefined
 
extension
 
and
 
.pt
 
is
 
not
 
part
 
of
 
it”
 Since  then,  weight  compatible  with  UVR  with  deleted  shared  bias  was  shared  (there  were  
actually
 
only
 
zeroes).
 
Also,
 
with
 
mask
 
estimator
 
method,
 
just
 
one
 
stem
 
file
 
can
 
be
 
extracted
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
full
 
weight.
 
Vocals
 
only
 
were
 
shared,
 
but
 
config
 
for
 
UVR
 
will
 
rather
 
require
 
some
 
tweaks.
