    -  IntroC  created  a  script for  mitmproxy  for  Capcut  allowing  fullband  output,  by  slowing  down  the  track.  Video   Older  Capcut  instruction:  The  video demonstration  of  below:  0.  Go  offline.  1.  Install  the  Chinese  version  from  capcut.cn 2.  Use  these files  copied  over  your  current  Chinese  installation  in:  C:\Users\(your  account)\AppData\Local\JianyingPro   Don’t  use  English  patch  provided  below  (or  the  separation  option  will  be  gone)  3.  Now  open  CapCut,  go  online  after  closing  welcome  screen,  happy  converting!  4.  Before  you  close  the  app,  go  offline  again  (or  the  separation  option  will  be  gone  later).   !  Before  reopening  the  app,  go  offline  again,  open  the  app,  close  welcome  screen,  go  online,

If

you

of
 
the
 
instruction.
 
  (no  longer  works  after  4.6  to  4.7  update,  as  it  freezes  the  app)  The  only  thing  that  seems  to  
enable
 
vocal
 
separation
 
without
 
requiring
 
replacing
 
everything,
 
is
 
to
 
replace
 
that
 SettingsSDK folder  contents  inside  User  Data.  It's  probably  the  settings_json  file  inside  responsible  for  that.  FYI  -  the  app  doesn’t  separate  files  locally.   The  quality  of  separation  vs  Capcut  is  not  exactly  the  same  as  Ripple.  Seeing  by  
spectrograms,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
information
 
in
 
vocals
 
in
 
Capcut,
 
while
 
Ripple
 
has
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
information
 
in
 
spectrum
 
in
 
instrumentals.

 You  can  replace  the  zh-Hans.po  file  with  English  one to  have  English  language  on  Chinese  version  of  the  app  possessing  separation  feature  in:  jianyingpro/4.6.1.10576/Resources/po
