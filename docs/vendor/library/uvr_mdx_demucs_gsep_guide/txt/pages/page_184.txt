 Mainly  for  vocals,  but  can  be  still  a  decent  all-rounder  deprived  of  noise  present  in  unwa’s  
inst
 
v1e/v1/v2
 
models,
 
also
 
with
 
fewer
 
residues
 
than
 
in
 
Kim
 
FT
 
by
 
unwa,
 
and
 
also
 
more
 
consistent
 
model
 
than
 
Kim
 
Mel
 
model
 
in
 
not
 
muffling
 
instrumental
 
a
 
bit
 
in
 
sudden
 
moments.
 The  third  highest  bleedless  instrumental  metric after  Mel-Kim  model  (after  unwa  ft2  bleedless  in  vocals).   It  seems  to  fix  some  issues  with  trumpets  in  vocal  stem  (maxi74x1).  
It
 
handles
 
reverb
 
tails
 
much
 
better
 
(jarredou/Rage123).
 Noisier/grainier  than  beta  4  (a  bit  similarly  to  Apollo  lew's  vocal  enhancer),  but  less  muddy.  
“The
 
noise
 
is
 
terrible
 
when
 
that
 
model
 
is
 
used
 
for
 
very
 
intense
 
songs”

 Phase  fixer  for  v1  inst  model  doesn’t  help  with  the  noise  here  (becruily).  
“It's
 
a
 
miracle
 
LMAO,
 
slow
 
instrumentation
 
like
 
violin,
 
piano,
 
not
 
too
 
many
 
drums...
 
 
it's
 
perfect...
 
but
 
unfortunately
 
it
 
can't
 
process
 
Pop
 
or
 
Rock
 
correctly”

“the
 
vocal
 
stem
 
of
 
beta5e
 
may
 
have
 
fullness
 
and
 
noise
 
level
 
like
 
duality
 
v1,
 
but
 
it
 
may
 
also
 
suffer
 
kind
 
of
 
robotic
 
phase
 
distortion,
 
yet
 
may
 
also
 
remove
 
some
 
kind
 
of
 
bleed
 
present
 
in
 
other
 
melrofo's.”

 It  can  struggle  with  trumpets  more  than  the  other  Mel-Roformer  on  MVSEP  [whether  
08.2024
 
or
 
Mel-Kim,
 
can’t
 
remember].
