     -  cyatarow  with  unwa  found  a  way  to  use  MSST  natively  on  Windows  on  RX  9060  using  ROCm  and  released  PyTorch  for  ROCm  for  Windows  without  having  to  use  WSL  -  click  -  Instruction  for  MSST-WebUI  has  been  made  too  -  click   -  Our  user  had  some  success  in  porting  our  Colabs  to  Keggle.  Inference  Colab  and  Apollo  
ones
 
have
 
been
 
made
 
so
 
far,
 
but
 
the
 
porting
 
process
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
rather
 
straightforward.
 Be  aware  that  it  might  gradually  fall  behind  with  any  newer  models  published  in  later  periods.   https://www.kaggle.com/code/zzryndm/music-source-separation-training-inference-webui  https://www.kaggle.com/code/zzryndm/apollo-colab-inference-i-fucking-give-up-with-this  How  it  was  done  -  “I  didn't  even  have  to  debug  anything.  Pasting  the  Colab's  code  without  changes  worked  
miraculously.
 Kaggle  doesn't  support  markdown  IN  code  cells  but  I  found  a  workaround  using  U+200C  for  
the
 
variable
 
names.
 
 Also  set  the  acceleration  to  GPU  P100.  It's  better  than  t4x2.  I  learned  that  through  the  
"patience
 
is
 
a
 
virtue"
 
route.
 And  trust  me  when  i  say  it  was  NOT  fun”  -  ryn  (xxml)   -  Gabox  voc_fv7  beta  3  added  to  the  Colab  -  (MVSEP)  “Four  new  models  have  been  added:  1)  MVSep  Percussion  (percussion,  other)  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251128141738-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 2)  MVSep  Keys  (keys,  other)  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251128142835-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 3)  MVSep  Brass  (brass,  other)  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251128142905-f0bb276157-mixture.wav 4)  MVSep  Woodwind  (woodwind,  other)  Demo:  https://mvsep.com/result/20251128143157-f0bb276157-mixture.wav  -  Unwa  BS-Roformer  HyperACE  inst  model  has  been  added  to  a  separate  Colab  -  Gabox  released  two  new  models  (vocal  and  instrumental):  Mel  vocfv7beta3 |  yaml Voc.  fullness  21.82  |  bleedless  30.83   |  SDR  10.80  “beta  1  and  2...  eh,  pretty  close  to  same  instrumental  bleed,  but  beta  3  def  a  step  up  from  the  two  songs  I  compared  (...)  most  songs  so  far,  fv7beta3  is  fuller  than  fv7beta1,  def  less  robotic  sounding  at  times  (when  a  voice  gets  quiet/hard  to  capture,  and  it  just  fails).
