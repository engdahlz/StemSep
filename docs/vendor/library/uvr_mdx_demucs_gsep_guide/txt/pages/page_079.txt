    -  unwa’s  fine-tuned  BS-Roformer  model  released  (12.59  for  instr)  -  worse  SDR  than  other  
fine-tuned
 
models
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
by
 
ZFTurbo,
 
but
 
better
 
SDR
 
than
 
Kim’s
 
MelRoformer
 
and
 
viperx
 
base
 
model
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q_M9rlEjYlBZbG2qHScvp4Sa0zfdP9TL/view  -   Mel-RoFormer  Karaoke  /  Lead  vocal  isolation  model  files  released  by  Aufr33  and  viperx  “If  you  will  use  this  model  in  your  project,  please  credit  us”  (download)  UVR  instructions.  Be  aware  that  online  version  on  uvronline/x-minus  seems  to  work  better.   -  doubledouble.top  will  be  soon  replaced  by  https://lucida.to/  -  Kimberley  Jensen  released  her  Mel-Band  Roformer  vocal  model  publicly  (download)  (simple  Colab/CML  inference/x-minus/MVSEP/jarredou  Colab too  now)  Works  in  UVR  beta  Roformer (model |  config -  place  the  model  file  to  models\MDX_Net_Models  and  config  to  model_data\mdx_c_configs  subfolder  and  “when  it  
will
 
ask
 
you
 
for
 
the
 
unrecognised
 
model
 
when
 
you
 
run
 
it
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
you'll
 
get
 
some
 
box
 
that
 
you'll
 
need
 
to
 
tick
 
"roformer
 
model"
 
and
 
choose
 
it's
 
yaml”.
 Use  overlap  2  for  best  SDR,  or  8  for  faster  inference  in  UVR)   -  SCNet  model  published  on  MVSEP.  Similar  metrics  to  MDX23C  model,  but  seems  to  leave  
lot
 
of
 
vocal
 
residues.
 “  it  is  based  on  SCNet-small  config  from  the  paper,  the  SCNet-large  config  is  almost  1   SDR  
above
 
in
 
the
 
reported
 
eval,
 
so
 
hopefully,
 
next
 
SCNet
 
model
 
trained
 
by
 
ZFTurbo
 
with
 
that
 
large
 
config
 
will
 
be
 
better
 
too.”
 
So
 
far
 
he
 
had
 
some
 
problems
 
training
 
on
 
large
 
config,
 
sadly.
  -  Slightly  better  Roformer  2024.08  model  (0.1  SDR+)  was  added  on  MVSEP  vs  2024.04  model  “it  seems  to  be  much  better  at  taking  the  vocals  when  there  are  a  lot  of  
vocal
 
harmonies.”
  -  (x-minus.pro/uvronline.app)  “In  the  new  interface,  the  BS-RoFormer  model  now  also  has  
De-mudder
 Select  the  Music  and  vocals,  BS-RoFormer  and  after  processing  you  will  see  the  De-mudder  
button
 
appear.”

 It  works  for  premium.   -  If  you  got  an  error  while  using  jarredou’s  Drumsep  Colab  ( object  is  not  subscriptable ):  change  to  this  on  line  144  in  inference.py:      if  type(args.device_ids)  !=  int:        model  =  nn.DataParallel(model,  device_ids  =  args.device_ids)  (thx  DJ  NUO)   -  (GSEP)  I  received  email  about  deletion  of  my  files  on  one  of  my  accounts  which  is  inactive,  
if
 
I
 
don’t
 
buy
 
premium
 
(haven’t
 
received
 
it
 
on
 
my
 
main
 
account
 
with
 
premium),
 
so
 
it's
 
probably
 
due
 
to
 
inactivity
 
and
 
no
 
premium.
 
It’s
 
probably
 
for
 
accounts
 
not
 
using
 
the
 
service
