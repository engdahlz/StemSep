    (HV)   For  clean  vocal,  you  can  also  use  ensemble  with  following  models:  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/767947630403387393/897512785536241735/unknown.png (REUim2005)   __How  to  remove  artefacts  from  an  inverted  acapella?_____   This  section  is  old,  and  “cleaning  inverts”  in  current  models section  can  provide  more  up-to  date  solutions.         0)  Currently,  GSEP  is  said  to  be  the  best  in  cleaning  inverts.  But  at  least  for  vocal  you  
can
 
use
 
some
 
MDX
 
model
 
like
 
Kim,
 
or
 
even
 
better
 
MDX23
 
from
 
MVSEP
 
beta.
  1)  by  charm   (rather  outdated)  Use  Vocal_HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m.pth  at  0.5  aggressiveness,  tta  
enabled
  then  use  any  model  u  like  with  Vocal_HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m.pth  instrumental  results  
to
 
filter
 
out
 
any
 
vocals
 
that
 
weren't
 
detected
 
as
 
vocals
 
with
 
Vocal_HP_4BAND_3090_arch-124m.pth
 
model
  combine  the  two  results   then  use  model  ensemble  with  whatever  models  u  like  (i  used  HP2  4BAND  1  and  2)   drag  both  vocal  hp  4band+another  model  and  ensemble  results  into  audacity   use  the  amplify  effect  on  both  tracks  and  set  it  to  -6.03   render   then  use  StackedMGM_MM_v4_1band_arch-default.pth   tbh  vocal  models  even  at  0  aggressiveness  really  help  inverts  Or  0.3   I  mostly  use  acapellas  for  mashups  and  remixes,  so  the  little  bit  of  bleed  i  get  at  0.0  
aggressiveness
 
is
 
fine
