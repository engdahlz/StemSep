 Optionally,  with  later  released  models  -  voc_ft  and  Kim  Vocal  2  -  It  doesn't  score  too  good  SDR-wise  on  newer  synth  dataset,  since  it  uses  older  models  
which
 
have
 
better
 
counterparts
 
already.

  Most  probably  you  can  safely  replace  Inst  HQ2  with  HQ3  and  4  (better  SDR)  getting  a  
slightly
 
better
 
SDR
 
in
 
ensemble
 
(it’s
 
just
 
not
 
tested
 
in
 
ensemble
 
yet).
  But  be  aware  that  “The  moment  you  introduce  Instrumental  models,  there  will  be  a  bit  of  
residue
 
in
 
the
 
vocal
 
output.
 However,  the  SDR  scores  higher.
