    Overlap   4  is  a  balanced  value  in  terms  of  speed/SDR  according  to  measurements (since  the  beta  patch  #3  or  later  used  above,  overlap  16  is  now  the  slowest (not  overlap  2  anymore)  and  overlap  4  has  a  bigger  SDR  than  overlap  2  now.   
Some
 
people
 
still
 
prefer
 
using
 
overlap
 
8,
 
while
 
for
 
others
 
it’s
 
already
 
an
 
overkill.
 
There’s
 
very
 
little
 
SDR
 
improvement
 
for
 
overlap
 
32,
 
and
 
for
 
50
 
there’s
 
even
 
a
 
decrease
 
to
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
overlap
 
4,
 
and
 
999
 
was
 
giving
 
inferior
 
results
 
to
 
overlap
 
16.
 
 
 
Compared
 
to
 
overlap
 
2,
 
for
 
8
 
“I
 
noticed
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
consistency
 
on
 
8
 
compared
 
to
 
2
 
(less
 
cut
 
parts
 
in
 
the
 
spectrogram).”
 
 
Instrumentals
 
with
 
overlap
 
higher
 
than
 
2
 
can
 
get
 
gradually
 
muddier.
  
Calculations
 
above
 
were
 
based
 
on
 
evaluations
 
conducted
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
on
 
MVSEP.
 
Search
 
for
 
e.g.
 
overlap
 
32
 
and
 
overlap

below,
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
see
 
the
 
results
 
to
 
compare:

between
 
them
 
to
 
alleviate
 
the
 
click
 
at
 
edges.”

[Tips  to  enhance  separation  results]  If  you  cannot  achieve  good  separation,  you  can  conduct  the  following  experiments   1.  De-bass   Turn  down  all  the  bass  to  stabilize  the  voice  frequencies  of  your  input  song  (example  EQ  curves:  1 and  2).   Male  setting:  cut  all  below  100Hz  +  cut  all  above  8kHz.  Female  setting:  cut  all  below  350Hz  +  cut  all  above  17kHz.  This  works,  because  jitter  is  reduced  a  lot.    2.  De-reverb   You  can  also  test  out  the  de-reverb  e.g.  in  RX  Advanced  8-10  on  your  input  song.  One  or  
both
 
combined
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
may
 
help
 
you
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
some
 
synth
 
leftovers
 
in
 
vocals.
 Alternatively  (not  tested  for  this  purpose),  you  can  also  try  out  this or  this (dl is  in  UVR's  Download  Center)  de-reverb  model  (decent  results).  Currently,  the  VR  dereverb/de-echo  
model
 
in
 
UVR5
 
GUI
 
seems
 
to
 
give
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
available
 
models
