    mdx_extra_q  -  quantized)  but  in  some  cases  that  might  be  worth  to  check  old  mdx_extra  
model
 
as
 
well
 
(but
 
  -  (outperformed  in  many  cases  when  used  at  least  as  a  single  models)   VR-architecture  models (Colab,  CLI  or  UVR5  GUI)  sometimes  provide  cleaner  and  less  muddy  results  for  instrumentals  than  single  narrowband  models  of  MDX  or  even  GSEP,  only

really

for

frequently

for

processed

in
 
contemporary

but
 
bleeding
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
specific
 
model:
 -  E.g.  500m_1  (9_HP2-UVR)  and  MSB2  (7_HP2-UVR)  models  are  the  most  aggressive  in  
filtering
 
vocals
 
among
 
VR
 
models,
 
but
 
other,
 
less
 
aggressive
 
VR
 
models
 
may
 
provide
 
better
 
sounding,
 
less

instrumentals
 
(only

it

[BTW.
 
I
 
haven’t
 
heard
 
the
 
newest
 
2022
 
VR
 
model
 
yet
 
(available
 
at
 
least
 
in
 
UVR5
 
GUI,
 
maybe
 
for
 
Patreons,
 
not
 
sure]).
 
  All  parameters  and  settings  corresponding  to  specific  models  you’ll  find  in  “VR  architecture  models  settings”  section.   -  VR  models-only  ensemble  settings -  if  your  track  doesn’t  have  too  many  problems  with  bleeding  using  VR-models  above,  to  fine-tune  the  results  achieved  with  VR,  and  to  get  rid  of  
some
 
mud,
 
and
 
e.g.
 
get
 
better
 
sounding
 
drums
 
in
 
the
 
mix,
 
I
 
generally
 
recommend
 
VR-architecture
 
models
 
ensemble
 
with
 
settings
 
I
 
described
 
in
 
the
 
linked
 
section
 
above.
 
 I'd  say  it's  pretty  universal,  though  the  most  time/resource-consuming  method.   Also,  these ensemble  settings  from  the  UVR  HV  Colab  seem  to  make  decent  job  for  extracting  vocals  in  some  cases  when  above  solutions  failed  (e.g.  claps  leftovers).  Check  also  demucs_6s  with  9  HP  UVR  and  gsep  in  min-specs  mode   Also,  UVR5  GUI  has  rewritten  MDX,  so  it  can  use  their  Demucs-UVR  models  from  Demucs

(I
 
think
 
mvsep
 
doesn't
 
provide
 
ensembling
 
for
 
any
 
MDX
 
models):
  -  (generally  outperformed  by  MDX-UVR  4xx  models)  Demucs-UVR  models  -  1  and  2  models  
beside

are
 
worth
 
trying
 
out
 
(mainly

on
 
their
 
own
 
if
 
the
 
results
 
achieved
 
with
 
above
 
methods
 
still
 
provide
 
too
 
much
 
bleeding

better
 
results
