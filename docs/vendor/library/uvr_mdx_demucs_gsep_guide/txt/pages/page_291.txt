    etc."  (by  BubbleG)   Q:  Won't  the  result  be  sped  up?  A:  “No.  Because  when  you  first  slow  it  down,  after  processing  with  said  model  it  gets  
converted
 
to
 
44100
 
again
 
(only
 
the
 
sample
 
rate,
 
not
 
the
 
actual
 
speed),
 
so
 
speeding
 
it
 
up
 
brings
 
the
 
speed
 
back
 
to
 
normal”
 
becruily
  Q:  I  don't  quite  get  what  I'm  supposed  to  do  though,  just  slow  down  the  file  to  0.75x  and  then  
export
 
in
 
58800?
 A:  “change  the  sample  rate  to  33075  Hz,  then  export  at  whatever  sample  rate  process  then,  change  the  sample  rate  of  the  processed  file  to  58800  Hz  key  word  being  change,  not  resample  like  this,  click  other  and  the  pick  the  correct  samplerate”  Dry  Paint  Dealer   4b*.  If  you  have  a  mix  of  soprano  and  baritone  voices,  you  possibly  can  do:  "1.  Soprano  mode  (slow  down  sample  rate),  then  bring  back  to  normal  after  that   2.  Tenor  mode  (speed  up  sample  rate),  then  bring  back  to  normal  and  finally  combine  the  two  with  max  algorithm"   Making  an  ensemble  of  such  results  can  also  increase  the  quality  of  separation.   5.  Use  2  stem  model  result  as  input  for  better  4-6  stem  separation    You  may  get  better  results  in  Demucs/GSEP/MDX23C  Colab  using  previously  separated

  6.  Debleed   If  you  did  your  best,  but  you  still  get  some  bleeding  here  and  there  in  instrumentals,  check  RX  10  Editor  with  its  new  De-bleed  feature.  Showcase  More methods  of  debleeding  stems.   7.  Vocal  model>karaoke  model   You  might  want  to  separate  the  vocal  result  achieved  with  a  vocal  model  with  MDX  B
