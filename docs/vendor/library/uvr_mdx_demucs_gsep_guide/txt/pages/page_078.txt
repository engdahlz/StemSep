     -  Cyrus  repaired  pip  issues  with  Medley  Vox Colab   -  Aufr33  released  MDX23C  de-reverb  model  files  https://a19p.uvronline.app/public/dereverb_mdx23c_sdr_6.9096.ckpt |  config “If  you  will  use  this  model  in  your  project,  please  credit  us  (me  and  jarredou)”  Also  added  on  MVSEP.  UVR  instruction:  “1.  Just  copy  model  to  Ultimate  Vocal  Remover\models\MDX_Net_Models  2.  Copy  .yaml  config  to  Ultimate  Vocal  
Remover\models\MDX_Net_Models\model_data\mdx_c_configs
 3.  When  opening  UVR,  selecting  dereverb_mdx23c_sdr_6.9096  from  the  MDX-Net  process  
method,

it's
 
not.
 4.  Select  config_dereverb_mdx23c  from  the  dropdown.  Done.”  ~Bas  Curtiz  5*.  In  case  of  “no  key”  error  in  UVR,  changed  line  30  in  the  config  to:  No  dry  But  it  doesn’t  happen  to  everyone.   -  New  UVR  Dereverb  model  added  on  uvronline.app  for  premium  users.  It  seems  to  handle  room  reverb  better  than  the  previous  MDX23C  model,  and  the  Foxy’s  
model
 
sometimes
 
cut
 
“way
 
too
 
much”
 
than
 
this
 
new
 
model.
  -  People  cannot  separate  using  Ripple  since  longer  than  August  12th.  There's  an  error  
"couldn't

  -  MDX23C  De-reverb  model  by  Aufr33  released  for  premium  users  of  uvronline.app.  “Thanks  to  jarredou  for  helping  me  create  the  dataset”   -  Jarredou  released  v.  2.5  of  MDX23  Colab  adding  the  new  Kim  Mel-Roformer  model.  Final  SDR  is  higher  (17.64  vs  17.41  for  instrumentals,  with  2024.08.15  MVSEP Ensemble  being  17.81).  https://colab.research.google.com/github/jarredou/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2/blob/v2.5/MVSep-MDX23-Colab.ipynb “Baseline  ensemble  is  made  with  Kim  Melband  rofo,  InstVocHQ  and  selected  1296  or  1297  
BS
 
Rofo”
