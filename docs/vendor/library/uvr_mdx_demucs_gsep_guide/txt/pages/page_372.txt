 Besides  WAV,  paid  users  get  exclusive  unreleased  VR  model  when  aggressiveness  is  set  to  
minimum.
 As  the  site  development  dynamically  progresses,  some  info  above  can  be  outdated.   
MSST  /  MSST-GUI  by  ZFTurbo  Repository  of  MVSEP  creator  and  model  trainer:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training It  can  be  used  either  for  training  or  also  inference  (separation  using  models).   MSST-GUI by  Bas  Curtiz  (default  list  of  models  can  get  outdated,  but  you  can  provide  file  paths  manually  there  too)  other  GUIs  linked  at  the  bottom.  The  GUI  has  screen  reader  
compatibility
 
unlike
 
UVR
 
5.6.1.
  Unlike  in  UVR,  MDX-Net  v2  and  VR  archs  are  unsupported  here   Don’t  install  Python  from  MS  Store,  or  you  might  get  “1920”  error  about  privileges.   Works  on  CPU  or  NVIDIA  GPUs  (by  default  it  uses  GPU  if  it’s  properly  configured),  and  in  
some
 
specifc
 
ase
 
it
 
can
 
separate
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
times
 
faster
 
than
 
UVR
 
on
 
some
 
GPU
 
archs
 
with
 
e.g.
 
8GB
 
GPUs
 
(on
 
4GB
 
it
 
might
 
be
 
even
 
slower).
 
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
tested
 
on
 
Linux
 
and
 
ROCm

not

(the

has
 
some
