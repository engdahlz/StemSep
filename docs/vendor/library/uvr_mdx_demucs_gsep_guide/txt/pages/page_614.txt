     ___  Might  be  potentially  useful  for  any  training  in  Colab  (by  HV,  2021):    “function  ConnectButton(){      console.log("Connect  pushed");       document.querySelector("#top-toolbar  >  
colab-connect-button").shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click()
 
 }  setInterval(ConnectButton,60000);   <-  enter  this  on  console  (not  cell)   and  keep  Colab  on  foreground.   It's  not  really  good  to  train  in  Colab  at  all,  due  to  its  limitations.  If  you're  training  because  you  want  a  better  model  than  v5/v4  mgm  models,  stop  it,  you  won't  
surpass
 
mgm
 
models
 
with
 
just
 
Colab.
 
However,
 
you
 
could
 
subscribe
 
to
 https://cloud.google.com/gcp and  watch  some  YouTube  tutorials  how  to  utilise  its  resources  to  Colab.”    _____________________________________________________________________  (archived)   Sidechain  stem  limiting  guide  by  Vinctekan   Hello  all,  I  am  here  to  share  the  definitive  answer  to  exporting  sets  of  stems  with  consistent  
and
 
loudness
 
and
 
brickwall
 
like
 
mixing,
 
when
 
a
 
manual
 
mixture
 
of
 
pairs/stems
 
are
 
too
 
loud
 
or
 
are
 
modified.
 Even  though,  pairs  like  this  probably  won't  have  to  be  used  for  training  in  the  future,  it's  still  
going
 
to
 
be
 
super
 
important
 
for
 
evaluation
 
for
 
said
 
models,
 
or
 
techniques
 
that
 
any
 
of
 
you
 
may
 
discover
 
in
 
the
 
future.
  I  discovered  this  through  this  video,  the  details  and  specifics  behind  are  explained  in  this  if  
you
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
recreate

plugin
 
in
 
the
 
REAPER
 
DAW
 
to
 
mix
 
your
 
stems
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
when
 
you
 
mix
 
them
 
together
 
in
 
Audacity
 
with
 
the
 
"Mix
 
and
 
Render"
 
option,
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
perfect
 
waveblock
 
like
 
mix,
 
with
 
no
 
clipping
 
and
 
no
 
distortion.
