    Now  if  you're  not  afraid  of  mixing,  and  e.g.  if  you  have  clear  instrumental  already  or  whole  
track
 
to
 
remaster,
 
I
 
used
 
for
 
such
 
a
 
task:
 -  v.  quiet  mixture  (original  file  with  mixed  vocals)  -  stems  from  demucs_ft  or  BS-Roformer  SW  (both  MDX23 Colab  or  Ensemble  of  various  models  on  MVSEP  can  be  even  better  than  Demucs,  and  vs  SW  esp.  for  bass  -  check  out  4  stems section)  mixed  with  also:  -  drumsep MDX23C  free  model  result  (but  you  can  also  test  out  stems  from  the  old  drumsep  and  LarsNet  [although  they  have  worse  SDR],  or  newer  MVSEP  drumsep  models)  -  GSEP  result  for  piano  or  guitars  (MVSEP  models  can  be  handy  too,  now  the  SW  model  for  
those
 
stems
 
are
 
much
 
better,
 
and
 
previously
 
the
 
only
 
downloadable
 
decent
 
guitar
 
model
 
released
 
becruily,
 
and
 
demucs_6s
 
is
 
mediocre,
 
now
 
we
 
have
 
SW)
 -  for  bass  both  GSEP  and  Demucs  ft/MDX23  aligned  and  mixed  together  (or  simply  from  MVSEP  ensemble  or  MDX23  Colab)  or  see  bass  models for  more  recent  list  -  I  think  "other"  stem  could  have  been  paired  that  way  too  (but  drums  remained  only  from  
e.g.
 
Demucs_ft
 
-
 
they
 
were
 
cleaner
 
than
 
GSEP
 
and
 
good
 
enough)
 -  Actually  in  one  of  those  guitars  weren't  recognized  in  guitar  stem,  but  were  in  other  stem,  
so
 
I
 
mixed
 
that
 
all
 
together
 
(it
 
wasn't
 
busy
 
mix)
 -  If  it's  not  instrumental,  probably  mixing  more  than  one  vocal  model  might  do  the  job,  check  various  vocal  ensembles (but  it’s  essentially  what  MDX23  and  ensembles  on  MVSEP  do,  but  the  latter  with  private  models,  it’s  not  exactly  the  same  -  you  can  add  different  effects  for  
every
 
of
 
such
 
tracks,
 
having
 
fuller
 
sound
 
and
 
change
 
their
 
volume
 
manually).
  The  all  above  gave  me  an  opportunity  for  a  very  clean  mix  and  instruments  using  various  
plugins
 
while
 
setting
 
correct
 
volume
 
proportions
 
vs
 
mastering
 
just
 
instrumental
 
separation
 
result
 
or
 
plain
 
3
 
stems
 
from
 
Demucs.
 For  example,  demucs_ft  or  other  single  or  incorporated  drums  model  provides  much  higher  
quality
 
of
 
drums
 
than
 
the
 
old
 
Demus
 
drumsep
 
during
 
mixing,
 
so
 
in
 
such
 
case
 
you
 
won’t
 
use
 
its
 
stems
 
on
 
its
 
own,
 
but
 
you
 
will
 
use
 
drumsep
 
more
 
to
 
overdub
 
the
 
specific
 
parts
 
of
 
instruments
 
more
 
(e.g.
 
snares
 
-
 
that’s
 
the
 
most
 
useful
 
part
 
of
 
using
 
drumsep
 
as
 
normally
 
it’s
 
easy
 
to
 
bury
 
snare
 
in
 
a
 
busy
 
mix
 
when
 
hi
 
hats
 
kick
 
in
 
overly
 
in
 
a
 
heavily
 
processed
 
instrumental
 
stem
 
or
 
drums
 
stem
 
-
 
not
 
you
 
won’t
 
have
 
to
 
push
 
drums
 
stems
 
from
 
demucs_ft
 
or
 
MDX23
 
so
 
drastically).
  Sam  Hocking’s  method  for  enhancing  separated  instrumentals  from  a  mixture  (song  
containing
 
instrumental
 
and
 
vocals):
  “I  think  looking  at  spectrally  significant  things  like  snares  can  work.  We  can  already  do  it  
manually
 
by
 
isolating
 
the
 
transient
 
audio/snare
 
pattern
 
as
 
MIDI
 
and
 
then
 
triggering
 
a
 
sample
 
from
 
the
 
track
 
itself
 
to
 
reinforce,
 
but
 
it's
 
time-consuming
 
and
 
requires
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
sound
 
engineering
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
sound
 
invisible.”
  You  can  probably  use  Cableguys  Snapback  plugin  for  that,  or  maybe  UVI  Drum  replacer.  Sam’s  method  will  work  the  best  in  songs  with  samples  instead  of  live  recordings  (if  the  same  sounds  repeat  across  the  whole  beat).  More of  those  plugins.
