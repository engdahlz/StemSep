 Q  (isling):  Is  there  a  way  to  just  listen  to  360  files  locally  while  still  getting  the  immersive  3d  
effect?
 Decoding  them  and  listening  in  DAWs  don't  sound  like  how  they  do  on  Amazon  Music  for  
example.
 Is  there  even  a  way  to  listen  to  them  without  decoding?  I've  downloaded  the  MPEG-H  
software
 
stuff.
 The  MPEG-H  format  player  doesn't  read  the  decoded  WAVs  nor  supports  m4a  which  is  what  
the
 
original
 
non-decoded
 
files
 
are.
 The  360  WalkMix  player  didn't  work  either.   https://github.com/ittiam-systems/libmpegh/releases This  one  is  the  one  I  use,  works  great  to  use,  but  doesn’t  have  the  same  3D  effect.  I  tried  playing  the  decoded  360  Reality  Audio  stems  in  VLC  as  it  has  the  best  Dolby  effect,  
but
 
it
 
didn't
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
channels
 
playing.
  A  (Sam  Hocking):  I've  worked  it  out,  there's  a  free  decoder.  These  are  the  main  MPEG-H  tools  for  both  creating  and  playing  MPEG-H  3D:  https://mpegh.lze-innovation.de/ All  free.  The  plugin  is  really  cool.  Request  the  plugin  from  their  site.   Dolby  and  Sony  360  are  object  based  [not  channel  base  like  Ambisonics].  Sony  360  is  just  
protected
 
MPEG-H
 
3D.
  When  you  rip  from  Tidal,  you  can  choose  how  you  decode  the  file  to  channel-based  audio.  
This
 
is
 
the
 
point
 
of
 
object-based
 
audio,
 
you
 
decode
 
it
 
to
 
what
 
number
 
of
 
speakers
 
you
 
have
  If  you  use  tidal-gui,  enter  an  Android  token  from  your  Tidal  app  on  the  phone  and  download  
the
 
file,
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
decode
 
the
 
Sony
 
360
 
/
 
MPEG-H
 
by
 
the
