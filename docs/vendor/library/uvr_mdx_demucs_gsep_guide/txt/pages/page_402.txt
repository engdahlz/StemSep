       MDX-Net  Colab  by  HV  (March  2025)  Models  trained  by  UVR  team  models  (aufr33  &  Anjok)   
First  vocal  models  trained  by  UVR  for  MDX-Net  arch:  
9.703  model  is  UVR-MDX-NET  1,  UVR-MDX-NET  2  is  UVR_MDXNET_2_9682,  
NET
 
3
 
is
 
9662,
 
all
 
trained
 
at
 
14.7kHz
 (instrumental  based  on  processed  phase  inversion)   List  of  all  (newer)  available  MDX  models  at  the  very  top.   I  think  main  was  438  in  UVR  5  GUI  at  some  point.  At  least  now  it's  simply  main_438  (if  it  
wasn't
 
from
 
the
 
beginning,
 
but
 
it
 
was
 
easy
 
to
 
confuse
 
it
 
with
 
simply
 
main
 
model
 
or
 
even
 
inst
 
main)
  (use  MDX  is  a  way  to  go  now  over  VR)  Generally  use  MDX  when  the  results  achieved  with  
VR
 
architecture
 
are
 
not
 
satisfactory
 
-
 
e.g.
 
too
 
much
 
vocal
 
bleeding
 
(e.g.
 
in
 
deep
 
and
 
low
 
voices)
 
or
 
damaged
 
instruments.
 
If
 
you
 
only
 
want
 
acappella
 
-
 
it’s
 
currently
 
the
 
best
 
solution.
 
Actually
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
most
 
cases
 
now.
  MDX-UVR  models  are  also  great  for  cleaning  artifacts  from  inverts  (e.g.  mixture  (regular  
track)
 
minus
 
official
 
instrumental
 
or
 
acappella).
  (outdated)  9.682  might  be  better  for  instrumentals  and  inversion  in  some  cases,  while  9.7  for  
vocals,
 
but
 
better
 
check
 
already
 
also
 
newer
 
models
 
like
 
464
 
from
 
KoD
 
update
 
(should
 
be
 
better
 
in
 
most
 
cases)
 
and
 
also
 
check
 
Kim
 
Model
 
in
 
GUI.
  Generally  on  MVSEP's  multisong  dataset,  these  models  received  different  SDR  than  on  
MDX21
 
dataset
 
back
 
in
 
the
 
days.
  On  MVSEP  there’s  9.7  (NET  1)  model,  and  it  doesn't  have  any  cutoff  above  training  
frequency
 
for
 
inverted
 
instrumentals
 
like
 
currently
 
GUI
 
has.
 
For
 
(new)
 
model
 
it’s
 
vocal
 
423
 
model
 
and
 
possibly
 
with
 
Demucs
 
2
 
enabled
 
like
 
in
 
Colab,
 
but
 
it
 
doesn’t
 
have
 
a
 
specific
 
jaggy
 
spectrum
 
above
 
MDX
 
training
 
frequency
 
which
 
is
 
specific
 
to
 
inverted
 
vocal
 
4XX
 
models
 
from
 
that
 
period
 
including
 
Kim’s
 
model.
