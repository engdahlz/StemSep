do
 
iirc,
 
that
 
may
 
do
 
the
 
trick)

cancel

 -  AudioSep -  USS-ByteDance (for  providing  any,  at  least,  proper  sample)  -  Zero  Shot (currently  worse  for  SFX  vs  Bytedance)  -  custom  stem  separation  on  Dango  (paid,  10  seconds  for  free  Technically,  if  bird  noises  are  in  vocals,  then  equally:   -  RTX  Voice,   -  AMD  Noise  Suppression  or  even   -  Krisp  and   -  Adobe  Podcast   might  get  rid  of  them,  but  at  least  the  last  changes  the  tone  of  voice,  and  the  previous  may

are
 
paid)
 -  ERA  6 declipper  (released  in  bundle  for  free  after  they  were  bought  by  Meta)  -  Airwindows  AQuickVoiceClip  -  mainly  for  streamers  yelling  into  the  microphone  “It’s  not  a  
‘un-clipper’

it

a

 AI  tools  (not  plugins):  -  RemFX (contains  model  to  get  rid  of  distortion  and  compression;  “mostly  for  singular  sounds,  it  won't  work  for  whole  mixes  like  songs”)  -  Rukai (for  speech  and  instrumentals)  -  Amis (mainly  for  speech)  -  stet-stet’s  DDD (speech,  req.  decent  CML  knowledge  to  setup)  -  jeonchangbin49’s  De-limiter (HF |  Colab)  (“if  you  have  any  squished  tracks  that  apollo  doesn't  handle  well,  try  passing  it  through  that  AI  de-limiter  first”  -  macularguide  “parallel  mix  -  “define[s]  how  the  normalized  input  and  the  de-limited  inference  will  blend
