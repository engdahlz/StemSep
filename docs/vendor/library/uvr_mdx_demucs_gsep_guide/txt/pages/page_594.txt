    really  difficult  for  them  to  improve  any  further  in  the  next  epochs.  i’ve  already  tried  changing  
the
 
lr
 
to
 
5e-5
 
and
 
1e-5,
 
but
 
it's
 
still
 
the
 
same
 A:  “try  fiddling  with  adam's  betas  -  change  from  betas=(0.9,  0.999)  to  betas=(0.8,  0.99)  adamfactor  might  be  a  cool  thing  to  test  as  well  add  this  into  the  config,  it  might  work”    optimizer:    betas:  (0.8,  0.99)   (frazer)  Ident  like  in  a  new  line  equally  with  training  and  inference,  placed  below  training  (so  actually  
none)
 Q:  So  far  the  metrics  keep  improving,  unlike  the  previous  training.  It  didn't  just  cap  like  last  
time.
  Q:  After  e.g.  14  epochs,  you  can  try  out  restarting  the  checkpoint  from  the  best  SDR  weight  
because
 
it
 
will
 
do
 
this
 
"it's
 
weird.
 
The
 
optimizer
 
for
 
whatever
 
reason
 
gets
 
fucked
 
up

saves

slow.”
  Q:  how  do  i  make  more  metrics  show  up  like  this  during  training?  A:  --metrics  sdr  si_sdr  log_wmse  l1_freq  aura_stft  aura_mrstft  bleedless  fullness
