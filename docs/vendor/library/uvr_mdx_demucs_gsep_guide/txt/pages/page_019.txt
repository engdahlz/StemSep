    (model |  yaml |  Colab)  Despite  the  fact  that  “the  MVSep  Team  Karaoke  uses  the  MVSep  BS  model  to

it
 
further)”

becruily
 “It's  better  than  BS  Roformer  (mvsep  2025.07  and  inst  Resurrection)  at  low  frequencies,  but  
bad

I
 
think
 
it

better
 
phase

because
 
it
 
keeps
 
the

cleaner
 
(but
 
it
 
might
 
not

be
 
true
 
to

it
 
might
 
just
 
interpret/make
 
up
 
the

instead
 
of
 
actual
 
unmasking)”

  -  Dry  Paint  Dealer  Undr  released  Melband  Roformer  and  Demucs  (“or  at  least  I  think  this  is  the  correct  model  file”)  Lead  and  Rhythm  guitar  models.  “My  own  very  mediocre  model  for  it  that  I  never  shared.  It  does  work  but  has  issues  that  I  
imagine
 
any

won't.”
