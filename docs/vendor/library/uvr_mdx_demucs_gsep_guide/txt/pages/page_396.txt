    Firstly  -  sometimes  you  can  have  problems  with  opening  the  shared  folder  on  proper  account  
despite
 
changing
 
it
 
after
 
opening
 
the
 
link
 
(it
 
may
 
leave
 
you
 
on
 
old
 
account
 
anyway).
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
manually
 
insert
 
id
 
of
 
your
 
account
 
where
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
open
 
your
 
link
 
to.
 
E.g.
 
https://drive.google.com/drive
/u/9/
folders/xxxxxxxx
 
(where
 
9
 
is
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
your
 
account
 
ID
 
which
 
shows
 
right
 
after
 
you
 
switch
 
your
 
account
 
on
 
main
 
Google
 
Drive
 
page).
 After  you  opened  the  shared  UVR  link  on  your  desired  account,  you  need  to  add  the  shortcut  
to
 
your
 
disk
 
(arrow
 
near
 
folder’s
 
name)
 
and
 
when
 
it’s
 
done,
 
create
 
“track”
 
and
 
“separated”
 
folder
 
on
 
your
 
own
 
-
 
so
 
delete/rename
 
shared
 
“tracks”
 
and
 
“separated”
 
folder
 
and
 
create
 
it
 
manually,
 
otherwise
 
you
 
will
 
get
 
error
 
during
 
separation.
 
If
 
you
 
still
 
get
 
an
 
error
 
anyway,
 
refresh
 
file
 
browser
 
in
 
the
 
left
 
of
 
Colab
 
and/or
 
retry
 
running
 
separation
 
three
 
times
 
till
 
error
 
disappears
 
(from
 
now
 
on
 
it
 
shows
 
error
 
occasionally,
 
and
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
retry
 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time
 
and/or
 
click
 
refresh
 
button
 
in
 
file
 
manager
 
view
 
in
 
the
 
left
 
or
 
even
 
navigate
 
manually
 
to
 
tracks
 
folder
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
refresh),
 
Colab
 
gets
 
changes
 
like
 
moving
 
files
 
and
 
folders
 
on
 
your
 
disk
 
with
 
certain
 
delay.
 
And
 
be
 
aware
 
that
 
most
 
likely
 
such
 
way
 
of
 
installing
 
UVR
 
will
 
prevent
 
you
 
from
 
any
 
further
 
updates
 
from
 
such
 
account
 
with
 
shared
 
UVR
 
files,
 
and
 
on
 
the
 
account
 
you
 
shared
 
the
 
UVR
 
files
 
from,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
repeat
 
folder
 
operations
 
if
 
you
 
will
 
use
 
it
 
back
 
again
 
on
 
Colab.
  Comparing  500m_1  and  arch_124m  above,  in  some  cases  you  can  notice  that  the  snare  is  
louder
 
in
 
the
 
first,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
easily
 
make
 
it
 
up
 
using
 
mirroring
 
instead
 
of
 
mirroring2.
 
Downside
 
of
 
normal
 
mirroring
 
might
 
be
 
more
 
pronounced
 
vocal
 
residues
 
due
 
to
 
higher
 
output
 
frequency.
 
 Also,  in  500m_1  more  instruments  are  damaged  or  muffled,  though  more  aggressiveness  in  
the
 
default
 
setting
 
of
 
500m_1
 
sometimes
 
makes
 
an
 
impression
 
that
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
are
 
cancelled.
  (evaluation  tests window  size  272  vs  320  -  it’s  much  slower,  doesn’t  give  noticeable  difference  on  all  sound  systems,  272  got  slightly  
worse
 
score,
 
but
 
based
 
on
 
my
 
personal
 
experience
 
I
 
insist
 
on
 
using
 
272
 
anyway)
 (evaluation  tests aggressiveness  0.3  vs  0.275  -  doesn’t  apply  for  all  models  -  e.g.  MGM  -  0.09)  (evaluation  tests TTA  ON  vs  OFF  -  in  some  cases,  people  disable  it)   5a)  (haven’t  tested  thoroughly  these  aggressiveness  parameters  yet)  HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_1.pth   w  272  ag  0.01,  TTA,  Mirroring   5c)  HP2-4BAND-3090_4band_arch-500m_1.pth   w  272,  ag  0.0,  TTA,  Mirroring  2
