KaraFan  by  Captain  FLAM  (2  stems)   Colab w/  more  models  (AI  Hub  fork,  also  fixed),  fixed  org.  Colab,  org.  Colab (slow),  GUI,  GH  documentation How to  install  it  locally  (advanced),  alt.  tutorial,  or  easy instruction  Should  work  on  Mac  with  Silicon  or  AMD  GPU  (although  not  for  everyone)  &  Linux  with  Nvidia  or  AMD  GPU  &  Windows  probably  with  at  least  Nvidia  GPU,  or  with  CPU  (v.  slow)   -  For  Colab  users  -  create  “Music”  in  the  main  GDrive  directory  and  upload  your  files  for  
separation
 
there
 
(the
 
code
 
won’t
 
create
 
the
 
folder
 
on
 
the
 
first
 
launch).
  -  Sometimes  you’ll  encounter  soundfile  errors  during  separation.  Just  retry,  and  it  will  work   KaraFan  (don’t  confuse  with  KaraFun)  is  a  direct  derivative  of  ZFTurbo’s  MDX23  code  forked  
by
 
jarredou,
 
but
 
with
 
further
 
tweaks
 
and
 
tricks
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
best
 
quality
 
of
 
instrumentals
 
and
 
vocals
 
sonically,
 
but
 
without
 
overfocusing
 
on
 
SDR
 
only,
 
but
 
the
 
overall
 
sound.
 
  Its  aim  is  to  not  increase  vocal  residues  without  making  instrumentals  too  muddy  like  e.g.  
sometimes
 
HQ_3
 
model
 
does,
 
but
 
without
 
having
 
so
 
many
 
vocal
 
residues
 
as
 
MDX23C
 
fullband
 
model
 
(but
 
it
 
depends
 
on
 
chosen
 
preset).
 
   Since  v.  4.4  and  5.x  you  have  five  presets  to  test  out.   Presets  3  and  4  are  more  aggressive  in  canceling  vocal  residues  (P4  can  be  good  for  
vocals).
 
 Preset  5  (takes  12  minutes+  on  the  slowest  setting  for  3:25  track  on  T4)  has  more  clarity  of  
instrumentals
 
over
 
presets
 
3
 
and
 
4,
 
but
 
also
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
(although
 
less
 
than
 
P1
 
and
 
P2
 
(takes
 
8
 
minutes
 
for
 
3:24
 
track
 
on
 
the
 
slowest
 
setting).
  On  23.11.24  “Preset  5  was  corrected  to  be  less  aggressive  as  possible”.  All  the  below  Preset  5  descriptions  refer  to  the  old  P5.  The  original  preset  5  is  here,  and  is  less  muddy,  but  has  more  vocal  residues  (at  least  the  original  preset  contains  more  models  and  is  slower).
