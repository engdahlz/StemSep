 “This  new  model  is  [vs  the  narrowband  vocal  models],  by  far,  the  best  in  removing  the  most  
non-vocal
 
information
 
from
 
an
 
audio
 
and
 
recovering
 
formants
 
from
 
buried
 
passages...
 
But
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
also
 
removes
 
some
 
airy
 
parts
 
from
 
specific
 
words,
 
and
 
some
 
non-verbal
 
sounds
 
(breathing,
 
moaning).”
