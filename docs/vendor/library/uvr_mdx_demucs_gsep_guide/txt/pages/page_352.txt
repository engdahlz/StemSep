     -  The  GUI  also  has  all  4-6  stem  models  from  Demucs  4  implemented.  For  4  stem,  simply  
pick
 
up
 
_ft
 
model
 
since
 
it's
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
4
 
stems.

  -  You  might  consider  using  Nvidia  Studio  Drivers  for  UVR5.  Versus  Game  Ready  normal  
drivers,
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
more
 
stable,
 
but
 
less
 
often
 
updated.
 
You
 
can
 
check
 
your
 
current
 
type
 
of
 
drivers
 
in
 
GeForce
 
Experience
 
(but
 
if
 
you
 
don’t
 
know
 
which
 
ones
 
you
 
have,
 
they’re
 
probably
 
Game
 
Ready)
  Q:  Is  there  a  way  I  can  remove  models  I  already  have  downloaded?  I  want  to  remove  all  the  HP  models,  but  I  don't  want  to  delete  them  from  the  directory,  I  want  
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
back
 
if
 
I
 
need
 
them
  A:  Check  the  current  Download  center  and  if  all  the  models  you  want  are  there,  then  you  can  
delete
 
them
 
and
 
redownload
 
from
 
there
 
later
  1.  Delete  the  models  from  the  directory,  or  2.  Move  the  models  to  a  separate  folder  out  of  the  directory   -  At  least  since  introduction  of  Batch  mode  (now  default  and  the  only  option  in  5.6/Roformer  
patch),
 
stability
 
of
 
the
 
app
 
on
 
lower
 
VRAM
 
GPUs
 
got
 
improved,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
see
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
processing
 
on
 
4GB
 
GPU
 
vs
 
on
 
CPU,
 
while
 
11GB
 
GPU
 
doesn't
 
really
 
have
 
that
 
problem.
  Maybe  something  changed  since  batch  mode  was  introduced,  but  some  vocal  pop-ups  could  
be
 
fixed
 
only
 
with
 
chunks
 
set
 
to
 
50-60
 
(11
 
and
 
16GB
 
VRAM
 
cards
 
only)
 
in
 
the
 
older
 
UVR
 
versions
 
and
 
CML
 
code.
 Some  low  values  were  still  culprits  of  vocal  pop-ups  in  chunks  mode  (at  least  before  the  
patch).
 I’m  not  sure  if  the  way  of  handling  chunks  has  changed  since  the  integration  of  inference  
code
 
with
 
MSST
 
repo
 
in
 
for
 
MDX-Net
 
menu
 
models.
