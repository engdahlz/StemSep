    need  to  get  the  other  signal  10Hz  inward,  so  they  overlap.  I.e.:  12000  Hz  lowpass,  11990  Hz  highpass.  Here  is  the  video  demo:  https://youtu.be/h5yE5cpqqMU”   #3  Bash  script  to  automate  the  AAC/Opus  quality  combining  from  YT  audio   introC  eventually  wrote  his  bash  script  which  makes  an  alignment  (so  trimming  1600  
samples
 
from
 
m4a),
 
performs
 
cutoffs
 
and
 
joins
 
frequencies
 
of
 
both
 
files
 
for
 
you
 
-
 
without
 
an
 
overlap
 
issue
 
(tested
 
with
 
white
 
noise).
 
The
 
script
 
works
 
for
 
multiple
 
m4a
 
and
 
webm
 
files
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
name.
 
Probably,
 
MSYS2
 
(or
 
cygwin)
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
run
 this  script  on  Windows  or  for  W10/11  use  WSL  (read).    He  also  took  a  more  conservative  approach  here  and  changed  cutoff  frequency  from  
9600Hz
 
to
 
1400Hz
 
since
 
AAC
 
didn’t
 
perform
 
better
 
in
 
one
 
song,
 
but
 
below
 
1400Hz
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
rather
 
in
 
every
 
case.
 
What
 
cutoff
 
is
 
actually
 
the
 
best
 
might
 
be
 
sometimes
 depending  on  a  song.  The  script is  a  subject  to  change.

I
 
did
 
something
 
really
 
odd
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
higher
 
quality
 
instrumental:
 I  inverted  the  128kbps  AAC  YouTube  rip  into  the  original  to  get  the  acapella  I  took  the  subtracted  acapella  and  ran  it  through  AI  (mel-roformer  2024.10)  to  reduce  
the
 
compression
 
artifacts
 I  then  inverted  the  isolated  acapella  and  mixed  it  with  the  lossless  to  get  an...  unusual  
lossless
 
instrumental
 
file?
 
also
 
the
 
OPUS
 
stream
 
goes
 
up
 
to
 
20khz
 
but
 
I
 
feel
 
like
 
the
 
sample
 
rate
 
difference
 
is
 
gonna
 
cause
 
issues,
 
so
 
I
 
ended
 
up
 
ripping
 
AAC
 
(OPUS
 
is
 
48khz
 
while
 
most
 
music
 
is
 
44.1khz)”
