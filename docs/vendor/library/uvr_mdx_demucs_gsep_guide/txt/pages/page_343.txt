    had  to  be  skipped  due  to  processing  errors,  as  well  as  the  total  time  it  took  to  execute  the  
script.
  Last  but  not  least,  I  ran  this  script  on  a  vast.ai  rented  Ubuntu  based  VM  with  a  4090  GPU  
and
 
it
 
worked.
 
I
 
did
 
this
 
to
 
test
 
Linux
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
because
 
I
 
was
 
processing
 
over
 
4h
 
of
 
audio,
 
so
 
I
 
wanted
 
this
 
to
 
be
 
fast.
 
Keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
running
 
this
 
script
 
on
 
your
 
home
 
PC
 
with
 
a
 
bad
 
GPU
 
and
 
are
 
processing
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
audio,
 
it
 
can
 
take
 
quite
 
a
 
while
 
to
 
complete.
  Script  is  attached.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/13iY2knyABBU-MOaMN5_zNAoDHFMZY6SD/view?usp=sharing example  console  output  and  example  speaker  output:  https://discord.com/channels/708579735583588363/708579735583588366/1132503652033114192  Usage  instructions:   install  whisperx  and  its  additional  dependencies  such  as  FFmpeg  as  per  the  instructions  on  the  GitHub  page  https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX  Additionally,  install  pydub  (and  any  other  dependencies  you  might  be  missing  if  the  script  
gives
 
an
 
error
 
message
 
indicating
 
you
 
are
 
missing
 
a
 
dependency)
 install  ffmpeg-python,  make  sure  to  use  the  following  command  instead  of  pip  install  if  you're  
running
 
this
 
in
 
a
 
conda
 
environment,
 
otherwise
 
it
 
won't
 
work:
 
conda
 
install
 
-c
 
conda-forge
 
ffmpeg-python
 edit  the  script  to  include  your  huggingface  token  and  path  to  the  folder  containing  the  audio  
files
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
process
 run  the  script  simply  by  python  your_filename_here.py   Results  are  quite  good  for  what  it  is,  but  you'll  definitely  need  to  do  some  additional  editing  in  
audacity
 
and
 
ultimate
 
vocal
 
remover
 
or
 
whatever
 
afterwards
 
to
 
cut
 
out
 
music,
 
noise,
 
and
 
other
 
speakers
 
that
 
were
 
wrongfully
 
included.
 
It
 
definitely
 
works
 
best
 
with
 
speakers
 
that
 
appear
 
a
 
lot
 
in
 
the
 
audio
 
file,
 
like
 
main
 
characters.
 
It
 
does
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
job
 
at
 
separating
 
those.
  I  won't  provide  tech  support  beyond  this,  as  I  am  no  programmer  and  did  this  all  by  just  
directing
