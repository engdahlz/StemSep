    It  might  be  unnecessary  to  use  in  UVR  -  it  might  use  this  trick  for  BS-Roformer  models  
already,
 
but
 
for
 
2024.02
 
on
 
MVSEP
 
it
 
was
 
beneficial.
  The  trick  is  not  necessary  for  04.2024  BS-Roformer  model  (it  sounds  worse  after  inverting).    Furthermore,  for  some  muddiness  in  this  model,  you  can  use  the  premium’s  feature  -  
ensemble.
 
The
 
default
 
output
 
without
 
intermediates
 
should
 
be
 
enough
 
(min_fft
 
is
 
very
 
muddy,
 
and
 
max_fft
 
very
 
noisy).
 
Strangely,
 
the
 
result
 
from
 
Roformer
 
from
 
intermediates
 
might
 
sound
 
v.
 
slightly
 
better
 
(maybe
 
it
 
was
 
something
 
random).
 
The
 
ensemble
 
is
 
kinda
 mimicked  in  jarredou’s  MDX23  v2.4  Colab and  to  some  extend  it  can  be  mimicked  in  UVR  by  using  1296+1297+MDX23  HQ  ensemble  (or  copy  of  1296  result  via  Manual  ensemble  
instead,
 
for
 
faster
 
processing).
 Now  also  x-minus  has  drums  ensemble  feature  for  Roformer  models.   32b.  Fixing  muddiness  for  MDX-Net  (on  example  of  HQ_3  model)  -  inverting  trick   It's  less  muddy  when  mixture  is  inverted  and  mixed  with  separated  vocals  in  louder  parts,  but  
vs
 
the
 
instrumental
 
stem,
 
it's
 
worse
 
in
 
silent
 
parts
 
with
 
less
 
busy
 
mix
 
-
 
then
 
it
 
has
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues
 
than
 
the
 
instrumental
 
stem.
 When  vocals  were  inverted  instead  of  mixture,  it  was  more  muddy,  but  still  more  residues  
were
 
present
 
vs
 
OG
 
inst.
 
stem,
 
just
 
a
 
bit
 
less.
 
Can't
 
tell
 
how
 
it's
 
SDR-wise.
 So  you  can  combine  various  fragments  for  the  best  results.   33.  Descriptions  of  models,  pt.  2  Muddiness  of  instrumentals  in  specific  archs   Beside  changing  min/avg/max  spec  for  MDX  ensembling  (or  in  Colab  for  single  models),  
plus
 
aggression
 
for
 
VR
 
models,
 
or
 
manipulating
 
shifts
 
and
 
overlap
 
for
 
Demucs
 
models,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
know
 
that
 
some
 
models
 
or
 
AIs
 
sound
 
usually
 
less
 
muddy
 
than
 
others.
 
Like
 
e.g.
 
VR
 
tends
 
to
 
have
 
less
 
muddiness
 
vs
 
MDX-Net
 
v2
 
arch,
 
but
 
the
 
first
 
tends
 
to
 
have
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues.
 
Consider
 
using
 
HQ2/3/4/inst3/Kim
 
inst
 
for
 
fewer
 
residues
 
than
 
in
 
VR
 
arch
 
or
 
BS-Roformer.
 For  less  muddiness  than  in  MDX-Net,  consider  using  MDX23  Colab  2.0/2.1  or  2.2  (more  
residues)
 
or
 
KaraFan
 
(e.g.
 
preset
 
5).
  34.  Muddiness  of  4/+  stem  results  after  mixdown   UVR5  supports  even  64  bit  output  for  Demucs,  eventually  you  can  use  Colab  or  CML  
version
 
for
 
32-bit
 
float,
 
but
 
mvsep.com
 
supports
 
32
 
bit
 
output
 
in
 
MDX23
 
model
 
when
 
you
 
choose
 
WAV.
 
It
 
has
 
better
 
SDR
 
vs
 
Demucs,
 
anyway,
 
but
 
sometimes
 
more
 
vocal
 
residues.
  Then,  on  MVSEP  beside  4  stems,  you  have  also  instrumental  -  ready  mixture  of  the  three  for  
instrumental
 
in
 
32
 
bit
 
provided,
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
bad,
 
but
 
you
 
can
 
go
 
to
 
extreme,
 
and
 
download
 
e.g.
 
Cakewalk,
 
and
 
3
 
stems
 
separately,
 
and
 
now
 
in
 
Cakewalk:
