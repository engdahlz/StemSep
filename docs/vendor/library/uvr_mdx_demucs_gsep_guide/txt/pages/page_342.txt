    And  for  some  reason,  I  needed  to  install  these  with  normal  pip  like  below,  and  with  python  
3.8,
 
so
 
basically
 
twice,
 
otherwise
 
it
 
gave
 
module
 
not
 
found
 !  pip  install  pathvalidate  !  pip  install  yt_dlp   That  all  hassle  with  Python  3.8  is  necessary  because  numpy  on  Colab  got  newer  version,  
and
 
newer
 
ones
 
no
 
longer
 
supports
 
function
 
used
 
in
 
HV
 
Colabs,
 
as
 
they
 
got
 
deprecated.
   
Separating  people  in  recording   Guide  and  script  for  WhisperX by  Pashahlis/ai_characters    “A  script  on  the  AI  hub  discord  for  automatically  separating  specific  voices  from  an  audio  file,  
like
 
separating
 
a
 
main
 
character's
 
voice
 
from
 
an
 
anime
 
episode.
 I  massively  updated  this  script  now,  and  I  am  also  posting  it  here  now,  since  this  discord  is  
literally
 
about
 
that
 
kinda
 
stuff.
 Script  to  automatically  isolate  specific  voices  from  audio  files  (e.g.  isolating  the  main  character's  voice  from  an  anime  episode  where  many  different  
characters
 
are
 
speaking).
  After  literal  hours  of  work  directing  ChatGPT,  fixing  errors,  etc,  there  is  now  a  heavily  
updated
 
and
 
upgraded
 
script
 
available:
  I  encountered  some  transcription  errors  (musical  notes,  missing  speaker  or  start  and  end  
times)
 
that
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
entire
 
script
 
failing
 
to
 
work.
 
So
 
the
 
updated
 
script
 
now
 
skips
 
such
 
audio.
 
That
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
problem,
 
however,
 
as
 
for
 
a
 
22-min
 
file
 
it
 
skipped
 
only
 
16s
 
of
 
audio
 
and
 
the
 
errored
 
audio
 
is
 
just
 
music
 
or
 
silence
 
anyway.
  It  now  also  automatically  merges  all  your  audio  files  into  one  if  you  provide  multiple,  so  that  
the
 
speaker
 
diarization
 
remains
 
consistent.
 
This
 
increases
 
diarization
 
time
 
by
 
quite
 
a
 
lot,
 
but
 
is
 
necessary.
 
The
 
merged
 
file
 
will
 
be
 
temporarily
 
saved
 
as
 
a
 
.flac
 
file,
 
as
 
.wav
 
files
 
have
 
a
 
maximum
 
file
 
size
 
of
 
4gb.
 
The
 
resulting
 
speaker
 
files
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
script
 
are
 
created
 
as
 
.wav
 
again,
 
though,
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
unlikely
 
they
 
will
 
reach
 
4gb
 
in
 
size.
  I  also  added  helpful  messages  that  tell  you  at  which  state  of  the  script  it  currently  is  at  and  
which
 
audio
 
files
 
it
 
is
 
processing
 
at
 
the
 
start
 
with
 
the
 
total
 
length
 
of
 
audio
 
being
 
processed.
  I  also  made  sure  that  it  saves  the  speaker  files  in  the  original  stereo  or  mono  and  16  bit  or  32  
bit
 
format.
  At  the  end  of  the  script  execution,  it  also  lists  all  the  speakers  that  were  identified  in  order  of  
and
 
with
 
the
 
audio
 
length
 
for
 
each
 
speaker.
 
It
 
also
 
lists
 
the
 
total
 
amount
 
of
 
audio
 
length
 
that
