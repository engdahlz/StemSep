[page 107/642]
    4  is  a  balanced  value  in  terms  of  speed/SDR  according  to  measurements (since  the  beta  patch  #3  or  later  used  above,  overlap  16  is  now  the  slowest in  UVR  (not  overlap  2  is  the  slowest  anymore  when  it  was  set  the  opposite)  and  overlap  4  has  a  bigger  SDR  than  overlap  
2
 
now.
 
 
Some
 
people
 
still
 
prefer
 
using
 
overlap
 
8,
 
while
 
for
 
others
 
it’s
 
already
 
an
 
overkill.
 
There’s
 
very
 
little
 
SDR
 
improvement
 
for
 
overlap
 
32,
 
and
 
for
 
50
 
there’s
 
even
 
a
 
decrease
 
to
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
overlap
 
4,
 
and
 
999
 
was
 
giving
 
inferior
 
results
 
to
 
overlap
 
16.
 
 
Compared
 
to
 
overlap
 
2,
 
for
 
8
 
“I
 
noticed
 
a
 
bit
 
more
 
consistency
 
on
 
8
 
compared
 
to
 
2
 
(less
 
cut
 
parts
 
in
 
the
 
spectrogram).”
 
Instrumentals
 
with
 
overlap
 
higher
 
than
 
2
 
can
 
get
 
gradually
 
muddier.
 
The
 
info
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
evaluations
 
conducted
 
on
 
multisong
 
dataset
 
on
 
MVSEP.
 
Search
 
for
 
e.g.
 
overlap
 
32
 
and
 
overlap
 
16
 
below,
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
see
 
the
 
results
 
to
 
compare:
 https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/multisong_leaderboard?algo_name_filter=kim “overlap=1  means  that  the  chunk  will  not  overlap  at  all,  so  no  crossfades  are  possible  
between
 
them
 
to
 
alleviate
 
the
 
click
 
at
 
edges.”

in
 
MSST.
 
The
 
setting
 
in
 
GUI
 
overrides
 
the
 
one
 
in
 
yaml’s
 
setting.
 
 chunk_size   “Most  of  the  time  using  higher  chunk_size  than  the  one  used  during  training  gives  a  bit  better  
SDR
 
score,
 
until
 
a
 
peak
 
value,
 
and
 
then
 
quality
 
degrades.
 For  Roformers  trained  with  8  sec  chunk_size  [can  be  found  in  the  yaml],  11  sec  is  giving  best  
SDR
 
(then
 
it
 
degrades
 
with
 
higher
 
chunk
 
size)”

 All  the  notable  chunk_sizes  are  described  later  below.  Sometimes  chunk_size  can  influence  the  ability  of  picking  up  e.g.  some  screams  in  the  
model
 
(“kim's
 
can
 
do
 
it
 
if
 
you
 
mod
 
the
 
chunk
 
size”).
 
Lower
 
chunks
 
might
 
sound
 
a
 
bit
 
less
 
muddy.
 
Unless
 
they’re
 
set
 
too
 
high
 
and
 
VRAM
 
is
 
exceeded,
 
while
 
separation
 
still
 
doesn’t
 
fail
 
on
 
AMD/Intel,
 
various
 
values
 
should
 
provide
 
similar
 
separation
 
times,
 
esp.
 
for
 
NVIDIA
 
users.
  batch_size  (not  used  in  UVR,  but  in  MSST)   Leave  it  default,  but  for  faster  inference,  e.g.  Gabox  used  6.  Using  above  2  might  increase  
VRAM
 
usage.

forced
 
in
 
the
 
inference
 
Colab
 
(it
 
has
 
the
 
clicking
 
issue
 
with
 
that
 
setting
 
fixed
 
in
 
newer
 
MSST
 
code).
 “i.e.  instead  of  running  a  single  song  at  batch_size  =  1  you  can  run  2  at  the  same  time  
(batch_size
 
=
 
2)”
 
so
 
“you
 
can
 
use
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
song
 
to
 
process”
