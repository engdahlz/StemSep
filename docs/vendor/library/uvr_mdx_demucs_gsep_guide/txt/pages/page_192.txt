  -  BS-Roformer  2025.07  only  on  MVSEP  -  free  with  longer  queue  Vocals  bleedless:  38.25,  fullness:  17.23,  SDR:  11.89  
The
 
biggest
 
bleedless
 
metric
 
for
 
a
 
single
 
model
 
so
 
far.
 
Compared
 
to
 
previous
 
models,
 
picks
 
up
 
backing
 
vocals
 
and
 
vocal
 
chops
 
greatly
 
where
 
6X
 
struggles,
 
and
 
fixes
 
crossbleeding
 
and
 
reverbs
 
where
 
in
 
some
 
songs
 
previous
 
models
 
struggled
 
before.
 
 
Sometimes
 
you
 
might
 
still
 
get
 
better
 
results
 
with
 
Beta
 
6X
 
or
 
voc_fv4
 
(depending
 
on
 
a
 
song).
 
“Very
 
similar
 
to
 
SCNet
 
very
 
high
 
fullness
 
without
 
the
 
crazy
 
noise”
 
-
 
dynamic64,
 
“handles
 
speech
 
very
 
well.
 
Most
 
models
 
get
 
confused
 
by
 
stuff
 
like
 
birds
 
chirping
 
(they
 
put
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem),
 
but
 
this
 
model
 
keeps
 
them
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
vocal
 
stem
 
way
 
more
 
than
 
most.
 
I
 
love
 
it!”
 Works  the  best  for  orchestral  choirs  out  of  the  long  list of  other  models  (.elgiano).  It  can  be  better  for  metal  both  for  vocal  and  instrumentals  than  the  mesk’s  models,  a  lot  of  
the
 
times
 
(and
 
sometimes
 
the
 
best).
 The  first  iteration  of  the  model  (2025.06:  37.83/17.30/11.82)  received  two  small  updates  and  
was
 
replaced
 
by
 
2025.07.
 It’s  also  good  as  a  source  model  for  phase  fixer/swapper.   -  Mel-Roformer  2024.10  (Bas  Curtiz  model  fine-tuned  by  ZFTurbo)  on  MVSEP
