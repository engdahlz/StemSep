  _____________   Q:  “Hello,  we  are  now  getting  very  good  results  in  turning  music  that  includes  human  voice  
into
 
only
 
instrumental.
 
Sometimes
 
there
 
are
 
vocal
 
leaks
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
call
 
just
 
crumbs
 
or
 
whispers,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
that
 
important.
 
But
 
now
 
we
 
have
 
another
 
important
 
problem.
 
People

song
 
is
 
arranged
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
continuous
 
instrumental
 
music
 
is
 
heard,

when
 
the
 
vocal
 
part
 
is
 
deleted,
 
a
 
perception
 
of
 
silence
 
or
 
emptiness
 
can
 
occur.
 
It
 
is
 
as
 
if
 
the
 
music
 
does
 
not

continuity,

everything
