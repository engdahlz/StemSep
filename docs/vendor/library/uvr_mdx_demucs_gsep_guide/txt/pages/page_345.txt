[page 345/642]
    Optional  fork  of  UVR  GUI  for  AMD  and  Intel  cards,  currently  supporting  only  VR  Architecture  
and
 
MDX
 
using
 
DirectML
 
(Demucs
 
currently
 
not
 
supported).
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
Nvidia
 
card,
 
then
 
use
 
official
 
app
 
above
 
since
 
CUDA
 
is
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
faster.
 “A  four  minute  and  20  second  audio  takes  about  30  seconds  (including  saving)  using  
1_HP-UVR
 
on
 
an
 
Intel
 
Arc
 
A770
 
16GB.
 
It
 
takes
 
up
 
approximately
 
6GB
 
of
 
VRAM.”
 If  you  only  use  MDX  models,  in  most  cases  it  won't  be  faster  than  processing  with  CPU  -  i5  
4460
 
has
 
similar
 
performance
 
to
 
RX
 
6700
 
XT
 
here,
 
so
 
better
 
stick
 
to
 
official
 
app.
 Compared  to  Roformer  beta  #8,  it’s  still  much  faster  at  least  for  VR  models,  but  you  might  
get
 
some
 
issues
 
with
 
MDX-Net
 
models,
 
though.
 https://github.com/Aloereed/ultimatevocalremovergui-directml  Python  command  line  fork  of  UVR  5  with  current  models  support:  https://github.com/nomadkaraoke/python-audio-separator (moves  from:  https://github.com/karaokenerds/python-audio-separator)  It  was  based  on  some  outdated  UVR  code,  but  probably  got  updated  since  then  to  support  
more
 
models.
  
GUI  FAQ  &  troubleshooting  for  UVR   Start  with  reading  information  about  Roformer  patch and  its  common  issues  section   -  “If  you  enable  the  "enable  help  hints"  setting”  “you  can  hover  parameters  with  the  mouse,  
[and]
 
you'll
 
get
 
[settings]
 
info
 
hints
 
(...)
 
if
 
[it’s]
 
not
 
activated
 
by
 
default)”
  -  See  the  section  above for  UVR  installation  and  usage  guides   -  It's  not  guaranteed  to  run  on  older  versions  of  Windows  than  10,  so  do  it  at  your  own  risk.   “3.8.10  is  the  last  [Python]  official  installer  that  works  on  Win7,  however  I  was  able  to  find  an  
unofficial
 
[Python]
 
installer
 
from
 
GitHub
 
for
 
3.10.13
 
on
 
Win7
 
and
 
that
 
seemed
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
trick!
 
No

  -  You  may  encounter  “Encoding  failed.  ffmpeg/avlib  returned  error  code:  3221225477”  while  
using
 
Manual
 
ensemble
 
and
 
output
 
set

“Think
 
I've
 
found
 
my
 
problem.
 
I
 
used
 
a
 
full
 
build
 
of
 
FFMPEG
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
essentials
 
one.”
  -  “If  anyone  needs  the  solution  to  running  it  on  [MacOS]  Mojave+  go  to  the  Releases  page  
on
 
GitHub
 
scroll
 
down
 
to
 
5.5,
 
under
 
assets
 
grab
 
UVR
 
5.5
 
x86_64_9_29.dmg.
 
Confirmed
 
working
 
now
 
on
 
my
 
Mojave
 
machine.

  -  Installing  the  GUI  outside  the  default  location  on  C:\  drive,  esp.  with  older  versions  may  
result
 
in
 
e.g.
 
startup
 
issues
 
(although
 
they
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
fixed
 
in
 
5.6
 
and
 
Roformer
 
patches).
