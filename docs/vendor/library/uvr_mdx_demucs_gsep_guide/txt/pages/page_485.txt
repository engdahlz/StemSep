When
 
you
 
use

Amazon
 
links,
 
sometimes
 
they
 
must
 
be
 
deprived
 
of
 
some
 
information
 
after
 
“&”
 
mark,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
not
 
return
 
error
 
on
 
the
 
site,
 
but
 
because
 
they
 
contain
 
an
 
“album”
 
string,
 
you
 
might
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
whole
 
album
 
downloaded
 
instead
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
song
 
if
 
you
 
did
 
it
 
wrong.
 At  some  point  region  string  was  better  to  be  rather  US  instead  of  whatever  your  shared  links  
have
 
(it
 
seems
 
the
 
accounts
 
have
 
US
 
region),
 
but
 
other
 
regions
 
in
 
the
 
links
 
work
 
too,
 
and
 
curently
 
are
 
changed
 
automatically
 
to
 
US,
 
and
 
sometime
 
changing
 
them
 
manually
 
to
 
US
 
might
 
cause
 
another
 
error.

Lucida.
 
For
 
URLs,

(but
 
later
 
it
 
stopped
 
working
 
too

worked
 
rarely

with
 
specific
 
music,
 
then
