    Inst.  fullness  36.91,  bleedless  38.77,  SDR  17.27  “sounding  just  like  v1e+  after  phase  fix,  but  straight  out  of  one  single  model   (...)   quite  bleedy,  but  honestly  it's  a  fair  price  to  pay,  I  guess”  -  santilli_  Although  for  some  people  it  can  be  even  on  pair  with  v1e+  bleed-wise,  so  check  it  out  too  
(more
 
fullness).
 Note:  It  uses  its  own  inference  script.  “You  can  use  this  model  by  replacing  the  MSST  repository's  models/bs_roformer.py  with  the  repository's  bs_roformer.py.”  To  not  affect  functionality  of  other  BS-Roformer  models  by  it,  you  can  add  it  as  new  model_type  by  editing  utils/settings.py  and  models/bs_roformer/init.py  here (thx  anvuew).  For  error  while  installing  py  file  for  HyperACE  model  in  Sucial’s  WebUI:  from  models.bs_roformer.attend  import  Attend  ModuleNotFoundError:  No  module  named  'models'"  The  fix:  “SUC-DriverOld/MSST-WebUI  use  the  name  "modules"  and  
ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training
 
use
 
the
 
name
 
"models".
 
And
 
Unwa's
  
bs_roformer.py
 
that
 
you
 
replace
 
with,
 
also
 
use
 
"models".
 
So
 
you'll
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
coding
 
and
 
symlink
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
work.”

 Metrically  less  fullness  than  v1e+:  37.89,  but  more  bleedless:  36.53,  SDR:  16.65  (v1e+).  While  using  locally,  consider  changing  overlap  from  default  4  to  2  in  the  yaml  of  the  model.  
The
 
difference
 
won’t
 
be
 
really
 
noticeable
 
for
 
most
 
people,
 
but
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
faster.
 “Currently,  this  model  holds  the  highest  aura_mrstft  score  on  the  instrumental  side  of  the

 This  weight  is  based  on  the  following  weights.  Thank  you,  anvuew!”  -  unwa  “Does  seem  like  HyperACE  is  picking  up  more  instruments  than  v1e+  does  seem  like  slightly  worse  vocal  bleed  overall  (still  need  to  test  this  more,  though)...

IDK,
 
a
 
little
 
muddy
 
for
 
my
 
tastes.
 I  did  find  one  song/spot  and  resurrection  inst  was  on  par  with  hyperace  in  picking  up  the  
wind
 
instrument,
 
v1e+
 
lost
 
it
 
for
 
a
 
bit.
 I  have  found  in  the  past  that  resurrection  inst  generally  picks  up  more  instruments  than  v1e+  
(...)
 
fullness
 
of
 
HyperACE
 
is
 
much
 
closer
 
to
 
v1e+
 
than
 
resurrection
 
inst
 
(...)
 
it
 
gets
 
pretty
 
staticy
 
compared
 
to
 
v1e+
 
[on
 
some
 
drums]
 
(...)
 
v1e+
 
does
 
this
 
to
 
a
 
lot
 
less
 
extent
 it's  not  super  common,  though…  (...)  I'm  very  confident  in  saying  bshyperace  picks  up  more  
stuff
 
than
 
v1e+.
 resurrection  inst  does  pick  it  up  much  better  than  v1e+,  but  I  think  it's  still  too  quiet  resurrection  inst  really  does  just  pick  up  so  much  more  instruments,  despite  having  a  lot  less  
fullness”
