  -  (stephanie/UVR)  “Those  of  you  on  Linux  running  the  current  roformer_add+directml  branch  
that
 
cant
 
get
 
becruily's
 
karaoke
 
model
 
working
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
error:
 
 it  seems  editing  line  790  in  separate.py  setting  the  keyword  argument  strict  to  False  when  
calling
 
load_state_dict
 
seems
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
karaoke
 
model
 
load
 
and
 
infer
 
properly,
 
so
 
i
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
work
  model.load_state_dict(checkpoint,  strict=False)   I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  robust  workaround,  but  I  haven't  observed  anything  behaving  
differently
 
than
 
it
 
should
 
yet,
 
so
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
give
 
it
 
a
 
shot
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
work
  TL;DR  change  line  790  in  separate.py  to  the  codeblock  and  then  run  again  and  karaoke  
model
 
should
 
work”
  -  Aname’s  Mel-Roformer  4  stems  Large  added  to  inference  Colab  -  Apollo  Lew  Uni  model  can  be  also  used  as  denoiser.  It  tends  to  smooth  out  some  noise  in  higher  frequencies,  making  the  spectrum  more  even  there,  smoothing  out  the  sound  in  general  (example).   More  about  the  model  and  its  usage  -  click.   -  Becruily’s  Mel-Roformer  Karaoke  model  added  on  x-minus/uvronline  under  “Keep  backing  vocals”  option  and  in  the  inference  Colab  Most  likely,  you’ll  have  “”’norm’””  AttributeError  when  trying  out  that  model  in  UVR.  Read  here for  troubleshooting.  Use  melband-roformer  model  type,  not  v2.  Make  sure  you  use  the  latest  UVR  Roformer  patch -  older  patches  like  #2  will  show  RuntimeError  about  layers.   -  (becruily)  “I'm  releasing  my  first  karaoke  model.   It's  a  dual  model  trained  for  both  vocals  and  instrumental.  It  sounds  fuller  +  understands  
better
 
what
 
is
 
lead
 
and
 
background
 
vocal,
 
and
 
to
 
me,
 
it
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
any
 
other
 
karaoke
 
model.”
  “Compared  to  Aufr33’s  Melband  model,  it  can  achieve  e.g.  cleaner  pronunciation  in  some  songs  (examples)  -  neoculture  “It  is  the  best  available,  better  than  Mel  Kar,  UVR  BVE  v2,
