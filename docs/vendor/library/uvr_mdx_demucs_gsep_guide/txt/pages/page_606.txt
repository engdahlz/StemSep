Roformers,
 
but
 
with
 
more
 
noise.

  SCNet  Large  turned  out  to  be  good  for  piano  (vs  MDX23C  and  MelRoformer)  and  also  
drums
 
models
 
according
 
to
 
ZFTurbo.
 “He  also  said  SCNet  didn't  work  that  well  for  strings,  Aufr  didn't  have  luck  with  BV  model  as  
well”
 
“MDX23c
 
is
 
already
 
looking
 
better
 
on
 
guitar
 
after
 
5
 
epochs
 
than
 
scnet
 
after
 
100
 
epochs”
  “with  SCNet  I've  had  the  fastest  results  with  prodigy  [optimizer]”  becruily   Later,  ZFTurbo  released  SCNet  4  stems  (in  his  repo)  and  exclusive  bass  model  on  MVSEP.    There  was  also  an  older,  an  unofficial  (not  fully  finished  yet,  it  seems)  implementation  of  SCNet:  https://github.com/amanteur/SCNet-PyTorch   Experimental  BS-Mamba  git  clone  https://github.com/mapperize/Music-Source-Separation-Training.git  --branch
