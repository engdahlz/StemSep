    what  they  say,  it  doesn’t  support  YT  or  YT  Music/Tidal/Deezer  links,  so  you  need  to  use  their  
search
 
engine.
 
So
 
probably
 
the
 
max
 
output
 
quality
 
is
 
44kHz/16
 
bit.
 
It
 
doesn’t
 
seem
 
to
 
use
 
Tidal
 
(maybe
 
Deezer).
 https://doubledouble.top/ is  now  also  back  online  and  supports  Apple  Music  unlike  Lucida,  but  it  might  be  slower  and  go  offline  eventually  as  before.   -  Strings  model  based  on  MDX23C  arch  added  on  MVSEP.  It  has  low  SDR  yet  (3.84),  so  it’s  
hit
 
or
 
miss
 
whether
 
it
 
will
 
work
 
for
 
your
 
song,
 
but
 
some
 
people
 
had
 
even
 
good
 
results
 
at
 
times.
 
ZFTurbo
 
plans
 
to
 
work
 
on
 
it
 
further.
  -  Finally,  HQ_4  released  in  March  has  been  added  also  on  MVSEP  (it  was  also  added  on  x-minus/uvronline.app  not  long  ago  via  this link  at  least)   -  Beta  3  of  the  unwa’s  Mel-Roformer  fine-tuned  Kim’s  model  released.  Fine-tuning  was  
started
 
from
 
scratch
 
on
 
enhanced
 
dataset
 
made
 
with
 
help
 
of
 
Bas
 
Curtiz.
 
As
 
the
 
result,
 
the
 
model
 
is
 
free
 
from
 
the
 
high
 
frequency
 
ringing
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
beta
 
models.
 
 “I've  added  hundreds  of  GB  worth  of  data  to  my  dataset”.  Download |  Colab "definitely  better  than  Kim's  now"  although  vocal  residues  might  occur  yet,  and  then  use  
unwa’s
 
BS-Roformer
 
fine-tune
 
instead.
 
SDR
 
is
 
slightly
 
lower
 
than
 
Kim
 
Mel-Roformer.
 
It’s
 
good
 
for
 
RVC.
  -  The  Lew’s  model  was  added  to  jarredou’s  Colab  -  Lew  released  a  model  for  Apollo,  serving  to  enhance  vocal  results  of  Roformers  https://ufile.io/09560o34 “You  can  use  it  in  Music  Source  Separation  Training  repo,  and  it  should  be  compatible  with  jarredou  Apollo  Colab”  Links  a  bit  below  (not  compatible  with  UVR).    -  Beta  2  of  the  unwa’s  Mel-Roformer  fine-tuned  model  released  (Colab).  Be  aware  that  both  models  have  some  ringing  issues  in  higher  frequencies.  Hard  to  say  if  it  
will
 
be
 
fixed
 
in
 
the
 
further
 
training,
 
Unwa
 
explaining
 
said
 
it
 
was
 
mainly
 
made
 
with
 
vocals
 
in
 
mind
 
so
 
it’s
 
not
 
sure.
  -  Unwa  released  beta  version  of  still-in-training  Mel-Roformer  fine-tuned  model  of  Kim’s.  Not  
tested
 
SDR-wise,
 
but
 
might
 
give
 
better
 
results
 
than
 
the
 
old
 
Unwa’s
 
BS-Roformer
 
model
 
already.

 https://huggingface.co/pcunwa/Mel-Band-Roformer-big/tree/main  In  UVR  consider  using  dim_t  =  1501  at  the  bottom  of  the  yaml  (can  be  slow),  but  1333  or  
1301
 
can
 
be
 
better
 
for
 
e.g.
 
40
 
second
 
snippets,
 
while
 
the
 
biggest
 
SDR
 
is
 
for
 
1101
 
for
 
all
 
Roformers,
 
but
 
it
 
still
 
depends
 
on
 
a
 
song
 
what
 
gives
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
(in
 
reality,
 
even
 
SDR
 
for
 
each
 
song
 
is
 
different,
 
and
 
bigger
 
SDR
 
not
 
always
 
means
 
better
 
quality,
 
the
 
quality
 
using
 
specific
 
parameters
 
might
 
even
 
differ
 
in
 
certain
 
fragments).
