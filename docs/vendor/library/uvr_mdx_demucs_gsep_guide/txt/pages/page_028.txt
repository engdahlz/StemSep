    “pip  install  neuraloperator==1.0.2”.  “Please  note  that  since  FNO1d  appears  to  have  been  removed  in  the  new  version  of  
neuraloperator,
 
you
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
install
 
an
 
older
 
version.
 
[so
 
not
 
current

 4.  “Errors  may  also  occur  when  using  load_state_dict.  In  such  cases,  specify  strict=False  as  
an
 
argument.(at
 
utils/model_utils.py
 
line

  6*.  To  not  affect  functionality  of  other  BS-Roformer  models  by  that  file,  so  older  
BS-Roformers
 
will
 
still
 
work,
 
you
 
can
 
add
 
it
 
as
 
new
 
model_type
 
by
 
editing
 
utils/settings.py
 and  models/bs_roformer/init.py  here (thx  anvuew).  For  error  while  installing  the  bs_roformer.py  file  in  Sucial’s  WebUI:  from  models.bs_roformer.attend  import  Attend  ModuleNotFoundError:  No  module  named  'models'"  The  fix:  “SUC-DriverOld/MSST-WebUI  use  the  name  "modules"  and  
ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training
 
use
 
the
 
name
 
"models".
 
And
 
Unwa's
  
bs_roformer.py
 
that
 
you
 
replace
 
with,
 
also
 
use
 
"models".
 
So
 
you'll
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
some
 
coding
 
and
 
symlink
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
work.”

  7*.  Seems  like  MSST might  have  some  issues  with  GPUs  other  than  corresponding  archs  to  RTX  5000,  4000,  3000,  H100,  H200  or  maybe  using  ROCm,  resulting  in  SageAttention  error,  
forcing
 
slower
 
CPU
 
separation.
 
 In  that  case,  ensure  you  have  compatible  CUDA/torch/torchvision/torchaudio  installed:   Compatible  CUDA  version  requirement  for  GTX  1660  is  10  (e.g.  on  GTX  1060,  Torch  
2.5.1+cu121
 
can
 
be
 
used),
 
but
 
pip
 
doesn’t
 
find
 
such
 
package
 
of
 
Torch.
 
To
 
fix
 
it:
 *a)  Check  out  index-url  method  described  below:  pip  install  torch  torchvision  torchaudio  --index-url  https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  or  pip  install  torch==2.3.0+cu118  torchvision  torchaudio  —-extra-index-url  
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
 or  pip  install  torch==2.3.0+cu118  --extra-index-url  https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  and  pip  install  torchaudio==2.3.0+cu118  --extra-index-url  https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  Replacing  cu118  with  newer  cu121  or  even  129  seems  to  give  proper  working  URL  too.   Maybe  replacing  2.3.0  with  2.3.1  will  work  too.  *a2)  Alternatively,  you  can  try  to  install  it  from  here from  wheels  by  the  following  command:  “pip  install  SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl”  -  providing  full  path  with  the  file  name  
should
 
do
 
the
 
trick.
 
Just
 
for
 
the
 
location
 
with
 
spaces,
 
you
 
also
 
need
 
"
 
".
 
 On  GTX  1660  and  Turing  GPUs,  you  might  seek  for  e.g.  cu121/torch-2.3.1"  and  those  
various
 
CP
 
wheels
 
(there
 
are
 
no
 
newer
 
versions).
 JFYI,  the  official  PyTorch  page:  https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/ lacks  links  for  CUDA  10  compatible  versions  for  older  GPUs  other  than  v1.12.1  (which  is  
pretty
 
old,
 
and
 
might
 
be
 
a
 
bit
 
slower
 
if
 
even
 
compatible
 
at
 
all),
 
so
 
the
 
only
 
way
 
to
 
install
 
newer
 
versions
 
for
 
CUDA
 
10
 
is
 
the
 
--extra-index-url
 
trick,
 
as
 
executing
 
normally
 
“pip
 
install
 
torch==2.3.0+cu118”
 
will
 
end
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
version
 
not
 
found
 
error.
