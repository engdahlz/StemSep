    I  excluded  VitLarge  because  it  always  leaves  faint  vocals”   51.  Ensemble  only  extra  higher  frequencies   from  e.g.  HQ  3  model  with  narrowband  inst  3  model  -  guide  52.  Use  some  BV/Karaoke  model  first,  to  potentially  get  cleaner  instrumental  with  dedicated  
model
 
afterwards
  53.  Set  vocals  to  center  with  stereo  plugin  (guide  by  Musicalman)   Trick  [working]  with  the  [now  outdated]   BS-Roformer  karaoke  model,  though  it  may  work  on  
other
 
karaoke
 
models
 
too
 
(I
 
suspect
 
you
 
might
 
have
 
some
 
mileage
 
with
 
MDX
 
for
 
instance).
 
Anyway,
 
the
 
trick
 
has
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
separating
 
one
 
voice
 
from
 
other
 
sounds.
 
If
 
the
 
voice
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
separate
 
is
 
panned
 
centrally,
 
you're
 
already
 
in
 
luck;
 
the
 
model
 
should
 
expertly
 
separate
 
it.
 
If
 
not,
 
you
 
can
 
rotate
 
the
 
stereo
 
field
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
voice
 
is
 
as
 
close
 
to
 
the
 
center
 
as
 
possible
 
(I
 
use
 
the
 
Reaper
 
js
 
stereo
 
field
 
manipulator
 
plug
 
in
 
for
 
this).
 
Process
 
the
 
rotated
 
sound
 
with
 
the
 
karaoke
 
model
 
and
 
the
 
voice
 
you're
 
looking
 
for
 
will
 
magically
 
be
 
separated,
 
even
 
from
 
other
 
voices!
 
If
 
you
 
need
 
the
 
original
 
stereo
 
image
 
back,
 
simply
 
perform
 
the
 
opposite
 
rotation.
  54.  Method  for  cleaner  vocals  (by  YAZKEN*)   “Basically  you  do  2  vocal  extractions,  invert  the  polarity  of  one  of  them  and  render  it,  after  
that
 
you
 
invert
 
the
 
rendered
 
audio
 
and
 
choose
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
extractions
 
you’ve
 
made
 
and
 
listen
 
what
 
is
 
cleaner”
  55.  Spectral  editing  in  Audacity  explained  (by  CC  Karaoke)   I  typically  use  Audacity  ..  But  [...]  RX11  has  some  nice  shiny  toys,  so  maybe  try  that.  I  do  
things
 
the
 
hard
 
way.
  Here's  a  great  basic  example  when  using  the  (Roformer)  Karaoke  model.  It  can  really  
sometimes
 
struggle
 
with
 
the
 
hard
 
consonants.
 So  for  best  results,  you'll  often  need  to  isolate  those  in  the  main  vocal  stem  by  muting  out  all  
the
 
surrounding
 
sound,
 
and
 
then
 
mixing
 
them
 
back
 
in
 
with
 
the
 
backing
 
vocal
 
stem.
 
Of
 
course
 
by
 
doing
 
this
 
the
 
hard
 
consonants
 
will
 
often
 
be
 
too
 
loud,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
de-amp
 
the
 
volume
 
on
 
them
 
and
 
then
 
play
 
back
 
till
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
level
 
that
 
sounds
 
like
 
it
 
blends
 
properly.
 
 https://imgur.com/a/dyc9olh  Slightly  more  complex  example;  Where  the  vocal  lines  are  overlapping.  I  tried  drawing  green  
over
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
lines
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
difference.
 
Might
 
be
 
a
 
couple
 
mistakes
 
lol,
 
as
 
I
 
haven't
 
checked,
 
but
 
you
 
get
 
the
 
idea.
 
The
 
previous
 
sound
 
is
 
a
 
carrying
 
note,
 
whereas
 
the
 
next
 
line
 
is
 
a
 
'HA'
 
kinda
 
hard
 
hit
 
punching
 
words,
 
so
 
it
 
has
 
a
 
different
 
shape
 
to
 
it.
 
This
 
kind
 
of
 
more
 
obvious
 
difference
 
is
 
easier
 
than
 
say...
 
reverb…
