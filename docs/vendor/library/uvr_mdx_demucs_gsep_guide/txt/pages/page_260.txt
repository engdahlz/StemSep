    -  Audio  Damage  Deverb  -  Zynaptiq  UnVeil   -  Zynaptiq  Intensity  -  Thimeo  Stereo  Tool  (one  of  its  modules)  -  Acon  Dialogue:Extract  2  (dereverb,  denoise)   If  you  want  to  use  some  of  these  DAW  plugins  for  your  microphone  in  real-time,  you  can  use  
Equalizer
 
APO.
 Go  to  "Recording  devices"  ->  "Recording"  ->  "Properties"  of  the  target  mic  ->  "Advanced".  To  enable  a  plugin  in  Equalizer  APO  select  "Plugins"  ->  "VST  Plugin"  and  specify  the  plugin  
dll.
 
AFAIK,
 
VST3
 
is
 
unsupported.
  To  run  a  plugin  for  a  microphone  in  a  simple  app  and  send  it  to  any  output  device,  alternatively,  you  can  download  savihost3x64,  then  edit  downloaded  exe  name  to  the  name  of  your  plugin  you  want  to  use,  placed  nearby,  and  run  the  app.  Now  go  to  settings  and  set  
input
 
and
 
output
 
device
 
(can
 
be
 
virtual
 
card,
 
maybe
 
not
 
necessarily).
 
Contrary
 
to
 
Equalizer
 
APO
 
(irc)
 
it
 
supports
 
VST3
 
plugins
 
too.
 
Of
 
course,
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
use
 
DAWs
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
purpose
 
(Reaper,
 
Cakewalk
 
etc.
 
-
 
but
 
not

  They’re  also  on  X-Minus  now:  “The  "minimum"  and  "average"  aggressiveness  settings  use  the  Normal  version  of  the  
model.
 
The
 
Aggressive
 
one
 
is
 
used
 
only
 
at
 
the
 
"maximum"
 
aggressiveness.”
