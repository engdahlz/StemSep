[page 353/642]
    -  (no  chunks  in  5.6  anymore)  On  4GB  VRAM  cards,  you  can  encounter  crashes  with  the  
newest
 
instrumental
 
and
 
Kim
 
vocal
 
model
 
while
 
using
 
batch
 
processing.
 
Lowering
 
chunks
 
to
 
at
 
least
 
10
 
(but
 
better
 
lower,
 
sometimes
 
still
 
crashes)
 
should
 
help
 ___   There’s  no  way  to  bypass  3GB  free  disk  space  requirement  on  C:  drive,  even  for  AudioTools   -  If  your  disk  space  in  not  freed  after  separation,  check  in  PowerShell  if  you  have  Memory  
Compression
 
and
 
Page
 
Combining
 
enabled,
 
by
 
typing:
 MMAgent.  If  not  1)  Type:  Get-MMAgent  2)  Then:  Enable-MMAgent  -mc  (video  tutorial)  More  typical  ways  to  get  more  space  on  C:\  -   If  something  is  suddenly  eating  your  disk  space  on  the  system  disk,  check:  
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\CrashDumps
 
because
 
UVR
 
can
 
create
 
even
 
a
 
few
 
gigabyte
 
crash
 
dumps.
 
Consider
 
turning
 
on
 
compression
 
in
 
properties
 
for
 
that
 
folder.
 Also,  you  can  simply  search  for  *.dmp  and  delete  all  the  existing  crash  dumps  on  C:  drive.  -  You  should  have  around  20GB  of  free  space  on  C:  drive  after  UVR  installation  on  12GB  
RAM
 
configurations
 
for
 
separating
 
top
 
ensemble
 
settings
 
(it
 
uses
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
pagefile)
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
10GB
 
for
 
24GB
 
RAM
 
for
 
long
 
songs
 
on
 
4GB
 
VRAM
 
cards.
 
You
 
can
 
enable
 
pagefile
 
on
 
another
 
drive
 
as
 
well
 
if
 
you
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
space
 
on
 
the
 
system
 
drive
 
(better
 
if
 
it
 
was
 
an
 
SSD
 
as
 
well).
 
 -  Go  to  Safe  Mode  and  delete  your  GPU  drivers  with  DDU  -  it  will  delete  all  remain  remnants  
from
 
older
 
versions
 
of
 
drivers
 -  Delete  all  restore  points  besides  the  newest  -  Delete  cache  taking  the  biggest  amounts  of  space  in  your  browser  if  you  don't  want  to  clear  
browser
 
data
 
entirely
 
(e.g.
 
the
 
old-fashioned
 
cookie
 
cleaning).
 
 E.g.  in  Chrome  you  can  do  it  here:  chrome://settings/content/all?sort=data-stored  -  Consider  using  CompactGUI  for  using  a  better  compression  algorithm  for  system  
compression
 
than
 
built-in
 
context
 
menu.
 
Some
 
programs
 
compress
 
excellent.
 
E.g.
 
Office.
 -  Use  old-fashioned  disk  cleaning  feature  in  context  menu  of  disk  in  Computer,  and  click  on  
the
 
next
 
menu
 
to
 
see
 
more
 
entries
 
(but
 
cleaning
 
up
 
temp
 
in
 
appdata
 
and
 
Windows
 
folder
 
will
 
do
 
similar
 
trick)
 -  Consider  using  TreeSize  Free  in  order  to  investigate  the  biggest  files  and  folders  on  your  
partition
 -  Sometimes  Windows  Update  leaves  lots  of  unused  files  after  updates  are  installed  -  they  
can
 
be
 
cleaned
 
up
 
too
 
by
 
some
 
methods.
 This  command  helped  me  free  some  disk  space  in  the  past.  Iirc,  precisely  for  WU  cache  in  
C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution
 start  %systemroot%\system32\rundll32.exe  advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks  (it  will  take  up  to  
15
 
minutes,
 
leave
 
PC
 
for
 
some
 
time,
 
and
 
observe
 
how
 
some
 
processes
 
suddenly
 
use
 
CPU
 
or
 
disk,
 
and
 
suddenly
 
stop,
 
then
 
it's
 
done,
 
eventually
 
maybe
 
after
 
restart
 
the
 
space
 
is
 
freed)
 -  You  can  shrink  the  pagefile  to  min.  500MB  on  C:  drive  and  use  other  partition  for  pagefile  https://mcci.com/support/guides/how-to-change-the-windows-pagefile-size/ __
