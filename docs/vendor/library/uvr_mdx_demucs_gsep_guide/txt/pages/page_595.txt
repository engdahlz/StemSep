  _____    If  you  already  prepared  your  dataset,  here  is  a  step-by-step  guide  by  Bas  Curtiz  on:   
Setting  up  training  on  your  local  machine  (read  also  mesk’s  guide)  “Make  sure  you  have  all  dependencies  installed  for  ZFTurbo's  Training  &  Inference  script:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training/blob/main/docs/gui.md Update  Nvidia  drivers:  https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/ Set  power  plan  to  best  performance  +  never  fall  asleep.  Determine  what  the  fastest  drive  is  on/in  your  PC:  https://www.guru3d.com/download/crystal-diskmark-download/ Put  your  dataset  on  the  fastest  drive.   Read  and  apply  the  steps  at:  https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-train Notes:   a)  ZFTurbo's  repo  has  a  lot  of  config  files  to  start  with.  Pick  the  one  based  on  the  model  
type,
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
use,
 
inside
 
the
 
folder
 
/configs
 b)  Alternatively,  if  you  are  going  to  fine-tune  an  existing  model,  use  the  .yaml  associated   (unsure,  implementation  looks  unstable  or  smth  wonky)  To  train  locally,  assuming  you  don't  have  a  powerhouse  of  a  GFX  card,  add  this  line  in  
config:use_torch_checkpoint:
 
True
  a)  Learning  rate  wise,  If  you  are  training  a  model  from  scratch,  you  want  to  set  it  
higher:5.00e-04
 
is
 
used
 
by
 
ByteDance
 
for
 
example
 
(=0.0005)
 b)  If  you  are  fine-tuning  an  existing  model,  set  it  lower:  5.00e-06  is  recommended  
(=0.000005)
  Save  the  altered  config  and  add  your  handle  for  ex.
