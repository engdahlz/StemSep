scale
 
linearly,
 
so
 
might
 
be
 
not
 
that
 
affordable)
  RTX  3090  24GB  (CUDA  cores:  10496)   4070  Ti  Super  16GB  (CUDA  cores:  8448)   RTX  4070  Ti  12GB  (CUDA  cores:  7680,  it's  (still)  tasking  to  train  on  it,  and  Roformers  will  
achieve
 
worse

  2x  GTX  1080  (if  dual  GPU  scaling  would  be  decent  enough,  it’s  not  linear)   Not  mentioning  these:  RTX  2080  Ti  (CUDA  cores:  4352)  RTX  3060  12GB  (CUDA  cores:  4864)  GTX  1080  Ti  (CUDA  cores:  3584)   Sign  up  for  an  account  at  https://sites.google.com/site/vultrfreecredit?pli=1 Get  250  bucks  free.
