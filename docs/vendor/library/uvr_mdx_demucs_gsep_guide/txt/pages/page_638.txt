    ○  This  method  is  only  recommended  for  models  that  produce  very  muddy  
instrumentals!
  ●  Combine  Methods :  
 ○  It's  basically  a  weighted  mix  of  the  final  instrumentals  generated  by  
"Phase
 
Rotate",
 
"Phase
 
Remix,"
 
and
 
the
 
initial
 
instrumental.
 
 Demudder  in  UVR  doesn’t  on  4GB  VRAM  Intel/AMD  GPUs.   Phase  fixer/swapper  
(decreases
 
vocal
 
residues
 
in
 
instrumentals)
 The  method  was  invented  by  Aufr33  to  fix  noise  in  Roformers  models  trained  with  
instrumental
 
stem
 
target.
 
It
 
copies
 
phase
 
from
 
a
 
model
 
trained
 
with
 
vocal
 
stem
 
target
 
which
 
usually
 
gives
 
muddy
 
instrumentals
 
(e.g.
 
Kim’s
 
or
 
becruily’s
 
vocal)
 
and
 
copies
 
it
 
into
 
the
 
instrumental
 
model.
 
Initially
 
it
 
was
 
added
 
only
 
to
 
x-minus,
 
and
 
later
 
becruily
 
wrote
 
his
 
own
 
script
 
doing
 
the
 
same
 
(torch
 
and
 
librosa
 
implementations).
 
 Later  Anjok  implemented  it  into  one  of  the  UVR  Roformer  beta  patches  (Tools>Phase  
Swapper),
 
although
 
there
 
it
 
only
 
allows
 
changing
 
high
 
and
 
low
 
cutoff,
 
but
 
no
 
high
 
frequency
 
weight,
 
and
 
santilli_
 
found
 
out
 
that
 
increasing
 
it
 
from
 
0.8
 
to
 
2
 
is
 
beneficial
 
for
 
phase
 
swapping
 
from
 
becruily
 
vocal
 
to
 
instrumental
 
model
 
and
 
that
 
it’s
 
much
 
better
 
than
 manipulating  with  high  and  low  cutoff,  you  can  use  their  forked  Colab  here.   You  can  use  and  edit  original  phase  swap  Python  scripts  for  previously  separated  files  here.  The  result  is  -  less  noise  in  the  instrumental,  but  a  bit  more  muddiness  (usage  is  described  in  
the
 
link).
  Optionally,  in  Phase  Fixer  you  could  set  420  for  low  and  4200  for  high  or  500  for  both  and

for
 
source;
 
and
 
bleed
 
suppressor
 
(by
 
unwa/97chris)
 
to
 
alleviate
 
the
 
noise
 
further
 
(e.g.
 
phase
 
fixer
 
on
 
its
 
own
 
works
 
better
 
with
 
v1
 
model
 
to
 
alleviate
 
the
 
residues).
 
Besides
 
the
 
default
 
UVR
 
default
 
500/5000
 
and
 
Colab
 
default
 
500/9000
 
values,
 
you
 
could
 
potentially
 
“even
 
try
 
like
 
200/1000
 
or
 
even
 
below
 
for
 
2nd
 
value.”
  
“I
 
would
 
say
 
that
 
the
 
more
 
noisy
 
the
 
input
 
is,
 
the
 
lower
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
set
 
the
 
frequency
 
for
 
the
 
phase
 
fixer.”

  “The  optimal  FFT  size  I  found  is  896  or  maybe  1024.  The  default  that  UVR  and  MSST  uses  
is
 
2048.
 
At
 
least
 
for
 
ensembling
 
different
 
versions
 
of
 
a
 
song
 
in
 
different
 
codecs
 
(like
 
from
 
YT
 
or
 
SoundCloud).
 
I
 
haven't
 
actually
 
tried
 
this
 
with
 
stem
 
outputs,
 
but
 
I
 
probably
 
will
 
tomorrow.”
