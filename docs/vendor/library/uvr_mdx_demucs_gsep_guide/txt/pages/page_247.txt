    -  Audioshake  (both  electric  and  acoustic)  -  moises.ai   Separating  electric  and  acoustic  guitar  -  Use  a  model  from  one  of  two  the  categories  above,  e.g.  -  MVSep  Acoustic  Guitar  (“it's  separating  acoustic  from  electric  very  well,  even  in  fuzzy,  lo-fi  
recordings”

 -  “To  separate  electric  and  acoustic  guitar,  you  can  run  a  song  [e.g.  other  stem]  through  the  
Demucs
 
guitar
 
model
 
and
 
then
 
process
 
the
 
guitar
 
stem
 
with
 
GSEP
 
[or
 
MVSEP
 
model
 
instead
 
of
 
one
 
of
 
these].
 GSEP  only  can  separate  electric  guitar  so  far,  so  the  acoustic  one  will  stay  in  the  "other"  
stem.”
 -  “  medley-vox main  vs  rest  model  has  worked  for  me  to  separate  two  guitars  before”  -  moises.ai  “it's  not  perfect,  it's  good  when  the  solo  guitar  for  example  is  loud  then  it  can  be  
isolated
 
but
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
in
 
a
 
balanced
 
lead
 
and
 
rhythm
 
guitar,
 
it
 
can't
 
isolate
 
it”

“I
 
can

both
 
guitars
 
with
 
the

MVSEP
 
has,

the

when
 
the

has
 
long
 
delay
 
effects,
 
tons
 
of
 
reverb

when
 
these
 
effects
 
go
 
from
 
one
 
channel
 
to
 
another,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
depends
 
on
 
how
 
the

was
