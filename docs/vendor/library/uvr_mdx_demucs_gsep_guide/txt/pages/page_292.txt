    8.  The  same  goes  for  unsatisfactory  result  of  instrumental  model  -  you  can  use  MDX-UVR

to
 
clean

or

  9.  Mixdown  of  4  stems  with  vocal  volume  decreased  for  final  separation    An  old  trick  of  mine.  Used  in  times  of  Spleeter  to  minimize  vocal  residues.   Process  mixture  to  4  stems  and  then  mix  stems  in  a  way  that  vocal  is  still  there,  but  quieter,  
so
 
lower
 
their
 
volume,
 
and
 
set
 
drums
 
louder,
 
then
 
send
 
the
 
mixture
 
from
 
it
 
to
 
one
 
good
 
isolation
 
model/ensemble,
 
so
 
in
 
result
 
drums
 
after
 
separation
 
will
 
be
 
less
 
muddy,
 
and
 
possible
 
vocal
 
residues
 
will
 
be
 
less
 
persistent.
 
  But  it  was  in  times  when  there  wasn't  even  Demucs  (4)  ft  or  MDX-UVR  instrumental  models,  
where
 
such
 
issues
 
are
 
much
 
less
 
prevalent.
  10.  If  you  use  UVR5  GUI  and  4GB,  you  may  hear  more  vocal  residues  using  GPU  
processing
 
than
 
e.g.
 
while
 
using
 
11GB
 
GPU
 
(tested
 
on
 
NVIDIA).
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
use
 
CPU
 
processing
 
instead.
  11.  Fake  stereo  trick   Aufr33:  “process  the  left  channel,  then  the  right  channel,  then  combine  the  two.  [Hence]  the  
backing
 
vocals
 
in
 
the
 
verses
 
are
 
removed”
 
(it
 
still
 
may
 
be
 
poor,
 
but
 
better).
 
“I'm
 
having
 
to
 
process
 
as
 
L
 
/
 
R
 
mono
 
files
 
otherwise
 
I
 
get
 
about
 
3-5%
 
bleed
 
into
 
each
 
channel
 
from
 
the
 
other
 
channel,
 
but
 
processing
 
individually,
 
totally
 
fixes
 
that”

  On  an  example  of  Audacity:  import  your  file,  click  on  down  arrow  in  track  selection  near  its  label,  click  Split  Stereo  Track,  go  to  Tracks>Add New>Stereo  Track.  Mark  the  whole  channel,  copy  and  paste  on  one  of  the  tracks  you  divided  before.   It  will  overlap  the  same  mono  track  in  stereo  track,  so  the  same  across  both  channels.  Do  the  same  for  both  L  and  R  separately.  Then  separate  with  some  model  both  results  
separately.
 
Then
 
import
 
both
 
files
 
and
 
join
 
their
 
separate
 
channels
 
by
 
method
 
above.
 
Don’t
 
confuse
 
L
 
and
 
R
 
channel
 
while
 
joining
 
both.
  12.  Turn  on  Spectral  Inversion  in  UVR    it  can  be  helpful  when  you  hear  instruments  in  silent  parts  of  vocals,  and  sometimes  also  
using
 
denoiser
 
might
 
help
 
for
 
it
 
(although
 
both
 
can
 
make
 
your
 
results
 
slightly
 
muddier)
  13.  Chain  separation   For  vocal  residues  in  instrumental,  you  can  experimentally  separate  it  with  e.g.  Kim  vocal  (or  
inst
 
3)
 
model
 
first
 
and
 
then
 
with
 
instrumental
 
model.
