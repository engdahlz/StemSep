 “beware  of  the  song  where  there's  a  vocal  at  the  beginning  of  the  song,  using  v1e+  will  leave  
vocal
 
residue.
 
So
 
decide

change
 
into

as
 
well.”

  0*)  Mesks’s  metal  min_fft  ensemble  of  BS  07.2025  model  on  MVSEP  +  rifforge  model “it  keeps  the  "fullness"  of  the  rifforge  model  being  an  instrumental  focused  model  but  then  
also
 
removes
 
more
 
stuff

my

  0*)  Chained  separation  method  by  fabio06844  for  “very  clean  and  full”  instrumental.  1)  Go  to  MVSep  and  separate  your  song  with  the  latest  Karaoke  BS-Roformer  by  MVSep  
Team
 2)  On  its  instrumental  stem  result  use  DEBLEED-MelBand-Roformer  (by  unwa/97chris)  (model |  yaml |  Colab)  (despite  the  fact  that  “the  MVSep  Team  Karaoke  uses  the  MVSep  BS  model  to  
extract/remove
 
vocals,
 
then
 
applies
 
[the]
 
karaoke
 
model
 
to
 
that”,
 
it
 
was
 
told
 
to
 
be
 
not
 
enough
 
to
 
just
 
use
 
BS
 
2025.07
 
model
 
instead,
 
leaving
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
residues).
