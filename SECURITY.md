# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, send a private report with:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps (if available)
- Affected versions/commits
- Any suggested mitigation

## Response process

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 7 days
- Provide a status update within 14 days

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on the default branch.
